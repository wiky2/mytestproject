连小狗都不喜欢？

134
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,320
Is there a puppy here?
这里有小狗吗？

135
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,730
-You don't like puppies? -Okay, you are new.
-你不喜欢小狗？ -喂，你是新来的

136
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:37,110
Look, Chandler, I told you. Never tell anyone about this dog thing.
听着，钱德，我跟你说过 别跟其他人说你不喜欢狗

137
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,280
It's like Ross not liking ice cream.
这就像罗斯不喜欢冰淇淋

138
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,140
-You don't like ice cream? -It's too cold!
-你不喜欢冰淇淋？ -它太冰了

139
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,280
It's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
狗让我觉得很不舒服

140
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,050
Hurts my teeth.
我的牙齿冰得好痛

141
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,150
And I don't want you guys to hate me...
我不希望你们讨厌我…

142
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,020
but I don't think I can be around that dog anymore, okay?
但我不喜欢这只狗 待在我身边，好吗？

143
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,670
So either the dog goes or I go.
不是那只狗走，就是我走

144
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,210
Oh, my God!
我的天啊

145
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,310
How can I not get this?
我怎么可能答不出来？

146
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,040
I'm a college professor. I got 1450 on my SATs.
我是大学教授 SAT考了1450分

147
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,680
Twelve fifty.
是1250分才对

148
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,850
Damn, I forgot you were here.
该死，我忘了你在这里

149
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,750
We're gonna take Klunkers to Ross'.
我们得把克朗克送到罗斯家

150
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,220
We'll be back soon.
马上就回来

151
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,290
Can I ask you a question?
在你们离开前 我能问你们一个问题吗？

152
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,300
When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend...
如果一个男人跟女朋友分手了…

153
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:37,600
what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before making a move?
我得等多久才能采取行动？

154
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,470
I'd say about a month.
我想是一个月

155
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,770
Really? I'd say three to four.
真的吗？我觉得是三到四个月

156
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,930
Half-hour.
半小时

157
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,680
Interesting.
真有趣

158
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,320
When it's your assistant,  I'd say never.
但他是你的助理 我劝你别那么做

159
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:55,110
All right, Rach, the big question is,  does he like you?
好了，瑞秋，问题是 他喜欢你吗？

160
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,280
Because if he doesn't like you,  this is all a moo point.
如果他不喜欢你 这只是在对牛放屁

161
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,690
A "moo" point?
对牛“放屁”？

162
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,700
Yeah. It's like a cow's opinion.
对，牛不知道你做了什么

163
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,230
It just doesn't matter.
那不重要

164
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,210
It's "moo."
那是在“放屁”

165
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,210
Have I been living with him for too long, or did that make sense?
是我跟他同居太久 还是他的话真的有道理？

166
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,520
Don't listen to Joey.
别听乔伊的

167
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,420
Okay, would you look at him?
好吧，看看他的样子

168
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,390
He's obviously depressed. He's away from his family.
他很沮丧 家人又不在身边

169
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,560
What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
现在他需要你这个朋友

170
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,330
You're right. I'm sorry. Thank you.

-好吧，我会那么做的 -很好，照她们的话去做

172
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,240
No one ever listens to me.
反正没有人会听我的话

173
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,930
When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.
只要包装好看 没有人会在乎内容

174
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,152
-Hi. -Hi.
-嘿 -嘿

175
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,940
How you holding up?

176
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,840
Not bad.

-I'm sorry about your girlfriend. -Thanks.
-关于你女朋友的事我很遗憾 -谢谢

-Were you guys together a long time? -A year, on and off.
-你们在一起很久了吗？ -一年了，总是分分合合的

179
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,430
I thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.
我以为我们会相守一生 现在我不会那么想了

180
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,160
-Now that she broke up with you. -Yeah.
-因为她跟你分手了 -对

181
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,060
It's weird.
这真的很奇怪

182
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:23,710
I used to assume that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy.
我以前总以为我会遇见一个人 坠入爱河，过着幸福的生活

183
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:27,970
That all that was just a given. Lately, it's like, what if it's not?
好像很自然而然 最近我会想如果不是那样呢？

184
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,480
Do you ever have that feeling?
你有那种感觉吗？

185
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,210
No.
不

186
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,880
Yeah.
有

187
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,220
All the time. Constantly. It's terrifying.
我常有那种感觉 一直都有，那真的很可怕

188
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,720
But you know, then I figure it has to work out.
但后来我想通了 一定会有那个人的

189
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,720
Why?
为什么？

190
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,560
Because it has to.
因为一定有的

191
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,340
-You have all the answers, don't you? -No, no, I do. I really do.
-你真的什么都知道，对吧？ -没错，我真的什么都知道

192
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,200
-Thanks for talking to me. -Come on, what are bosses for?
-谢谢你陪我聊 -别这样，这不是上司的工作吗？

193
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,810
Hug it out.

194
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,510
All right, he likes you back.
好了，他也喜欢你

195
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,580
Told you you should go for it.
我说过你该表白的

196
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,220
What?
什么？

197
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,790
Street noise drown any of that out?
下面的噪音有没有盖过那句话？

198
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,590
No? See you later.
没有吗？待会见

199
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,860
Okay.
好吧

200
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,200
What did Joey say? I like you back?
刚刚乔伊说了什么？我也喜欢你？

202
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:34,770
Joey knows that I'm very insecure about my back.
乔伊知道我对我的背没信心

203
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,280
And you were hugging me...
刚刚你在抱我…

204
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,650
so obviously you are not repulsed by it. Yeah!
很明显地 你不讨厌它，没错

205
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,450
-Wait, that doesn't make any sense. -No?
-等一下，那根本就说不通 -是吗？

206
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,160
All right, here's the truth.
好吧，事实是这样的

207
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,840
Joey said what he said...
乔伊会那么说…

208
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,370
because I'm attracted to you.
因为我被你吸引

209
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,870

00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,540
Yeah, I admit it.
对，我承认

211
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:09,970
I have a crush on you. I know that's crazy because we work together...
我暗恋你，我知道那很疯狂 因为我们是同事…

212
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,880
and nothing could ever happen.
我们之间不该发生任何事

213
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,550
The last thing I wanted to do was freak you out...
我一点都不想吓到你…

214
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,760
or make you feel uncomfortable.
或是让你觉得不自在

215
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:22,490
Which is why it would be great if you said something right about now.
所以我认为你最好快说句话

216
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,260
Oh, my God. Those guys are stealing my car.
我的天啊，那些家伙在偷我的车

217
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,530

218
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:30,130
Right there. That's my car!

Do you have anything else to say?

221
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,900
I can't believe it.

222
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,980
We still have time to talk, and they're not even in the car yet.
我们还有时间谈 他们还没上车

223
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,150
Look, there they go.

224
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,520
Okay, Phoebe. We should probably go back now.
好了，菲比 或许我们该回去了

225
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,420
Please, don't leave me. I'll be lonely.
求求你别离开我 我会很寂寞的

226

-Okay, let's go. We can be strong. -Yeah, okay.
-我们走吧，我们可以很坚强的 -好吧

I can't leave her.

We could sneak the dog back and Chandler wouldn't even know.
我们可以偷偷把狗带回去 钱德不会发现的

231
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,600
That won't work.

00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,040
I've had that dog for three days, and Chandler had no idea.

Hey, what's she doing back here?

听着，菲比 我照位置将各州州名排好

没时间谈这件事了 我们不能让他靠近我房间

247
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,940
Monica's crying.

-That's ridiculous. -Oh, is it? Is it?!
-那太可笑了 -是吗？

253
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:43,790
Look, when Monica and I were kids,  we had a dog named Rover.
听着，摩妮卡跟我小时候 我们养了一只狗叫路佛

所以呢？把狗抱回来 你会成为大英雄的
