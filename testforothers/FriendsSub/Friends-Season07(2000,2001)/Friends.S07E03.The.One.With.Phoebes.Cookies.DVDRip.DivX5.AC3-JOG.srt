I don't want to talk about it.

You could've at least saved me a cookie.

I will tell the story.

he even said I could call him Dad.

151
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,950
Look,here's the story.

152
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,310
We had just finished playing, and we were gonna take a steam.

I walk into the room...

154
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,880
and it's really steamy.

155
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,620
So I take off my glasses, and that's when it happened.
于是我拿下眼镜 悲剧发生了

156
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,890

You gave my father a lap dance.

161
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,050

他们为什么 要把那里弄的雾气弥漫？

162
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:07,360
Because otherwise they'd have to call it the "room" room.
不那么做的话 那里只能叫做“房间”

163
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,930
Why? Why did that have to happen?

Come on,it's not that big a deal.

There was touching of things.

I'm sure Dad doesn't care.

170

He probably thought it was funny.

He'll be telling this story for years.

175
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,570
I wasn't escaping.
我才没有那么做

176
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,040
Then how'd you get caught in the barbed wire?

177
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,910
I was trying to help out a squirrel.

You were trying to eat it.

I'm off to see your dad.

Aren't you a little overdressed?

186
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,800
You better make sure he tips you this time.
你最好确定 这次他会付你小费

187
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,220
I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore...
我想说服他 别再提那件事…

188
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:35,320

我想最好的办法 就是跟他面对面谈一谈

But you couldn't move...

好老师会说： “把啤酒放下，猪头”？

如果我能喝完最后一罐啤酒 或许不会那么痛
