142
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,770

145
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,720
That'll be $400.

146
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,850
Joey, I saw you push him.
乔伊，我看见你推他了

147
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,860
You pushed him.

148
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,790
Joey,I did not break this. Okay? That has been broken for a while.
乔伊，我没把它弄坏 它已经坏一阵子了

149
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,330
Remember I told you about our fridge?

I still haven't gotten the check for your half yet.

Ross,I think you misunderstood what I was saying.

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,370
I think you misunderstood what I was saying.

00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,890
How did it go with Elizabeth?
你跟伊丽莎白谈得怎样？

171
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,460
Fine. Just a misunderstanding. She didn't want me to go with her.
没事，只是一场误会 她没有要找我去 

172
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,260
She just wanted to let me know she's going to Florida for a spring vacation.
她只是要告诉我她要去放春假

173
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,730
Wait a minute. Is she going for spring vacation or spring break? Wahoo!
等等，她是去放春假 还是去春游？

174
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,700
What's the difference?

175
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,140
Spring vacation, you're doing nice things with your grandparents.
春假是跟爷爷奶奶共享天伦

176
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,010
Spring break, you're doing frat guys.
春游是跟兄弟会的人上床

177
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,810
You know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.
并非每个人的春游都那样

00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,010
-What did you do on yours? -I went to Egypt with my dad.
你做了什么？ 我跟我爸去埃及

179

我可以想像 “爸，是人面狮身像”

180
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:49,130
I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than: "Spring break,wahoo!"
伊丽莎白那么正经 不会去“春游”

181
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,860
Come on, she's taking my class.
好吗？她修了我的课

273
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,640

-我知道我明天不用加班 -明天不错…

281
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:20,560
But why put off something till tomorrow that you could do it right now?
不过现在能做的事 为什么要拖到明天？

282
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,070
-Eldad,come here! -What?

290
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,950

This is the guy I was telling you about.

298
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:06,150
This suit does not do justice to what's underneath it.
相信我，这套西装 太委屈底下的身材了

299
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,440
Okay.
好

300
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:12,720
But, Phoebe, I'm just sort of in the middle of something.

超柔顺的，你摸摸看 不必了

-That's right. Bye-bye. -No.

Don't dance for me. Please!

What is the matter with you?

Yeah, let's talk it out.

Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?

I'm a little embarrassed.

I do not need you to get me a date.
很谢谢你们 但我不需要你们帮我找人

322
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:16,010
Then you chase away the one guy I actually liked.

323
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,780
No offense to you guys. Really, congratulations on...

And you really do have very soft hair.

326
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:30,660
But I'd much rather go to the ball by myself than go through any more of this.

-Did you pack that bathing suit? -Yeah.
你有带那套泳衣吗？ 有

I am worried about that suit.
我不是担心那套泳装太曝露 

337
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:08,000
Not because it's revealing, which I'm fine with.

Well, if what's in the bottle is actually 30.

358
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,500
I wanna say a disease.
我很想说是一种疾病

359
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:30,340

罗斯留了奇怪的留言 叫我们看MTV台
