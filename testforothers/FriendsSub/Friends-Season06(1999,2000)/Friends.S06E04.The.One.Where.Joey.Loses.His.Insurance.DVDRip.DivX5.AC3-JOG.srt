So you came back,huh?

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,680
They think they can do better, but they all...

Oh, well, no harm no foul.

153
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,830
Look, you gotta get me some work. I lost my health insurance.
艾丝黛，你得帮我找工作 我的健保没了

00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,370
All right, first thing we gotta do: damage control.

Wow,we really are bitches.

165
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,780
Right. So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory...

he made a startling discovery.

What he believed to be igneous was, in fact, sedimentary.
他原以为那是火山物质 其实是沉积物

168
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,550
Imagine his consternation when..

169
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,590
Oh, bloody hell.

00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,410
So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow.
明天艾丝黛帮我排了一堆试镜

And I'll have my health insurance back in no time.
我很快就能重新加入健保

That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?
太好了 但你现在应该去蹲马桶吧？

-What's wrong with you? -Nothing.
什么？ 你是怎么了？ 没什么

and I haven't been able to stand up since.

But I don't think it's anything serious.

This sounds like a hernia. Go to the doctor.
这应该是疝气，你得去看医生 我才不要

179
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:26,970
No way. If I go to the doctor, it'll be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
就算要去看医生 也是因为肚子这里突出来

180
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,380
That's a hernia.

Why'd I have to start working out again?

我上了台，学生都盯着我看

187
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,510
I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
结果我一开口就是英国腔了

188
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,330
Yeah, and not a very good one.

a lot probably,okay?
应该很贵

205
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:06,740
Besides,it's getting darker and more painful. That means it's healing.
而且它越来越黑，越来越痛 就表示有在好

Look, I'll loan you the money.

I can get all the free operations I want.

What's going on?

Just wanna each take one?

231
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,100
Look, I really need some help, okay?

I'm serious! Someone's gonna find out and then they're never gonna offer me a job.
我说真的，我迟早会被揭穿 教书的事就泡汤了

236
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,410
Why don't you phase it out? Yeah, phase the accent out.

People will think you're adjusting to life in America.

00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,350
Come on. No one will even notice.

They're probably not even listening to you.

They're not listening to me?

Everybody listens to you.

这时候你要把它搬起来 没错

260
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:16,130
The line is, "Pick up a bag," so you need to pick up the bag.
不是，台词是搬一包 所以你得把它搬起来

261
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,360
Or I could just point to it.

Purina One. Point to a bag today.
