It wasn't my best decision,but I couldn't face another failed marriage.
或许这个决定不好 但我无法面对另一次失败婚姻

At what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
我插个嘴 你觉得这段婚姻哪里成功？

00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,780
Well,there's an idea!
有办法了 没错

I'm okay. Are they having fun? Am I talking too fast?

Little Baby Girl Chandler. Where have I heard that before? Oh,Coach Rubin.
小女生钱德，我在哪里听过？ 对了，鲁本教练

90
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,890
Phoebe,when you're done over there, we've got a situation over here too.
菲比，等你那边忙完 我们这里也有状况

91
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,860
No. We are all responsible for our own babies.
不行，自己的小孩自己顾

92
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,440
That's where you're wrong. We've been playing them man-to-man.
那你就错了 我们一直采取人盯人战术

94
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,240
We should really be playing a zone defense.
但我们应该打区域联防

95
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,540
What do you mean?
什么意思？ 

96
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,010
Things'll go smoother if we each have a zone. Phoebe,be in charge of wiping.
我觉得一人守一区会比较顺畅 菲比，你可以负责擦屁屁

98
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,110
Mon,be in charge of diapering.
摩妮卡，你负责包尿布

99
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:09,750
I'll be in charge of looking at how cute they are when they put their hands...
我就负责看他们捉着我的手…

100
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,290
Sounds great, but you should be in charge of wiping.
好主意，也许你才应该擦屁屁

101
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,400
Okay,I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
我是菜鸟，不该守球门区

102
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:32,450
This is so great. This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.

103
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,450
Yeah? Well, this is not what I ordered.

I'm having the best morning.

107
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,150
That Porsche I've got the keys to? Still there.
那辆保时捷还在

108
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,860
Shocking, since you still have the keys.
不会吧，毕竟钥匙在你手上

109
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,990
You should see the treatment I get with that car.
你应该看看大家对我的态度

110
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:59,700
People are friendly. They wanna talk. And not just about the car.
每个人都很友善，找我聊天 而且不只是聊车子 

111
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,040
One guy advised me on my equity investments.

112

What equity investments?

The ones that got me the Porsche. Will you keep up?
赚到保时捷的股票投资 你跟上好吗？

114
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,180
If people see me just standing there, they're gonna think I don't own it.
但要是我光杵在那里 别人会觉得那不是我的车

115
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,850
So I figure I'll wash it. Monica, you got a bucket and soap?
所以我要洗车 摩妮卡，你有水桶和肥皂吗？

116
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:22,290
Oh,yeah. I got soap and sponges and rags...

You don't even have a car.
你根本没有车

119
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,330
I know. Once there was a dirty car in front of the building,so I washed it.
对，但楼下停过一辆很脏的车 我就把它给洗了

00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,810
Yeah,she tops out at 130.
它可以飙到130

123
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,120
That's just in the city. I get her up to 160 upstate.
这还是市内 到了郊外可以轧到160

124
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,760
Really? You got a place upstate?

00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,700
Just give me five more minutes.
再给我5分钟

130
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,740
What are you doing?

Listen,I don't come to the city much.
听着，我很少进市区

I'm not coming back.

138
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,900
-Why not? -I live upstate.

139
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,030
Yeah,so did I.
是啊，我本来也是

140
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,530
I don't know why I was so nervous...
我之前不晓得在紧张什么

141
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,770
and why Frank and Alice complain. This is easy.
法兰克他们为什么会抱怨 带孩子太容易了

142
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,810
Yeah, two hours, a lifetime, that's the same.
是啊，2小时和一辈子一样

143
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,420
Check it out! When the babies wake up...
你们看 宝宝醒来后

144

they can meet Krog!
可以认识克洛格

145
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,330
That thing could put someone's eye out.
你在干什么？那个东西会害人

146
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,830
He can do more than that. He can destroy the universe.
不只，他还能毁灭宇宙

147
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,390
They could swallow one of those little parts.
不，宝宝可能会误食那些零件

148
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:10,330
Also,look at his smooth area. That's just gonna mess them up.
而且那个光滑的部位 会误导他们

149
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,430
It's just not an appropriate toy for 1-year-olds. Or 30-year-olds.
这种玩具不适合1岁的宝宝 和30岁的男人

150
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,510
They won't swallow anything. You're too overprotective.
他们才不会误食什么 你们这叫保护过度

151
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,480
When I was a kid,my mom used to throw me into a pile of broken glass.
我小时候 我妈都把我扔在碎玻璃堆里

152
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,680
-What? -Glass, sand, whatever.

153
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,220
Look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
小莱丝莉边睡边伸懒腰 

154

Oh,it's so cute.
好可爱喔

155
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,920
I wonder when you stop putting both legs behind your head.
不知道要到几岁 才没办法把腿举到头上

156
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,330
I can still do that.
我现在还是可以

157
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,430
How are you still single?
你怎么会还没结婚？

158
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:47,970
I thought about it and maybe you're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
好吧，我想或许你们说得对 或许克洛格不够安全

159
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:52,040
-What made you change your mind? -I swallowed his sonic blaster gun.
你为什么改口了？ 我吞了音波死光枪

160
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,780
How did that happen?
怎么会这样？

161
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,310
I was trying to prove that I was right.
我想证明我是对的 

162
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,940
And it turns out I was wrong...
结果我错了

163
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,320
and now it's lodged in my throat.
现在它卡在我的喉咙里

164
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,700
This whole time we were concentrating on the babies...
真是的，我们光顾着带小孩 

165
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,560
and no one was watching Chandler!
都忘了要看着钱德

166
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,090
You are asking the court for an annulment?
两位要申请注销婚姻？

167
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,210
Yes, Your Honor. Here are our forms, all filled out.

168
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,610
So based on your petition...

169
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,470
you are seeking an annulment on the grounds...
你申请注销的理由是 

170
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:29,410
that "Mr. Geller is mentally unstable."
盖勒先生的精神状况不稳定

171
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,220
Fine. I'm mentally unstable.
好，我精神状况不稳定

172
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,590
And based on the fact that "Mr. Geller is an intravenous drug user."
而且他使用静脉注射毒品

173
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,060
-What? -Yes. Heroin and crack.
什么？ 是的，海洛因与快克

174
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,490
Crack isn't even an intravenous drug.
快克根本不是静脉注射毒品 

175
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,230
Well,you would know.
你当然了解了

176
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,630
Now, it also says here that you...
这上面还说...

177
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,740
"lied about your sexual preference before marriage."
你在婚前隐瞒性向

178
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,900
Oh,come on.

179
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,510
Ross,please. I found the magazines.
罗斯，我发现那些杂志了

180
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,910
And finally,that you were "unable to consummate the marriage."
还有你无法履行夫妻间的义务

181
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,920
Well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin.
这也难怪，你是同志 又上瘾海洛因

182
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,990
You know, I'm sorry, this is insane.
很抱歉，这太夸张了

183
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,030
I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay and there is no problem...
我没有上瘾海洛因 我不是同志

184
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,930
with my ability to consummate anything.

185
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,270
I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!
我现在就可以在这里履行

186
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,810
That won't be necessary.
没有这个必要

187
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:32,580
And when we were dating, we consummated like bunnies.
我们交往时简直跟兔子有得拼

188
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,850
If you were involved in a serious relationship, that creates a problem.
如果你们曾经认真交往 那就有问题了

189
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,390
Rest assured, that relationship ended two years ago.
大人，我们2年前就分手了

190
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,720
Strike "consummated like bunnies" from the record.
可以删掉“跟兔子有得拼”吗

191
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,860
Is there anything in this record that is actually true?
这份申请书有任何实言吗？

192
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,190
Well, yes. We got married in Vegas.
有，我们确实在赌城结婚 

193
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,300
And the names,I think.
名字应该也没错

194
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,730
That's not the way the legal system works.
这样不符合法律程序

195
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:02,600
This process is based on an objective review of the facts, not of the lies.
申请注销得根据客观事实 而不是谎言

196
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,770
Objection!
抗议

197
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,440
-It doesn't work like that either. -Overruled.

198
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,780
Oh,stop it.
别闹了

199
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,350
Based on what I've heard, you certainly don't qualify for an annulment.
从刚才的话听来 两位不符合注销资格

200
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,490
If you don't wanna be together, file for divorce.
如果你们不想在一起 就必须办理离婚

201
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:22,360
That's great. You happy? Look what you did with your funny, funny form.
太好了，你高兴了吗？ 都是你的搞笑表格害的

202
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,000
What? Me? What about you and your "consummated like bunnies" nonsense?
我？你那句跟兔子有得拼呢？

203
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,760
What are you typing that for? She said we don't get the annulment.
那…你打什么打？ 你听到没？我们不能办注销了

205
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,910
Don't type that. What..

你看你让我嫁的是什么人？

210
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,880
Get out of my chambers.
请两位离开我的办公室

211
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,550
Lady, here's the deal.
好，你给我听着

212
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,820
I came here for an annulment and I'm not leaving here until I get one!
我是来办注销的 没办成我绝对不走

213
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,450
-Would you like a night in jail? -Thank you for your time.
你们想在牢里过夜吗？ 耽误您了

214
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,520
That Porsche guy took his car back.
保时捷的主人把车开走了

215
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,460
But you found the keys to his clothes?
但你检到他的衣橱钥匙？

216
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:35,260
No, I just love the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
不是，我只是喜欢 大家以为我有保时捷的感觉

217
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,930
They'll think you own one because of the clothes?
你穿这样别人就会以为你有？ 

218
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,800
Of course.
那当然

219
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:43,800
Only an idiot would wear this stuff if he didn't have the car.
白痴才会没车还穿成这样

220
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,740
That is true.
那倒是

221
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:53,180
Yeah,but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
不过只有天才 才会误食音波死光枪

222
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,320
Oh,I've been there.

I am gonna go drive my Porsche.

拜托，你搞什么？ 我正在入戏，你说说她，好吗

I think it just moved. It's poking me.
它动了，现在真的好刺

227
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,600
We'll go to the emergency room.
够了，我们去挂急诊

228

No, you can't leave me here with them. We're babysitting.
什么？你们不能把我扔给他们 我们正在带孩子

宝宝都睡了 你撑一下一定没问题

但你们不能把我扔给他们 我们是一队的

231

在打区域联防 他们会以三打一

他的喉咙卡了个塑胶玩具 我们非去医院不可

保时捷

都是你的错 我的错？你威胁法官
