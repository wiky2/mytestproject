Drapes still closed?

And she was definitely giving me the vibe.

他是人力资源部的明日之星

137
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,910
Maybe I talk too much,or maybe I should have been more aggressive sexually.
也许我太聒噪了 也许我应该在性方面更主动

138
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,080
No,no,no.
不不不…

139
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,820
No,that would never have worked on Ross.
不要，罗斯不吃那套

But you know who that might work on? Bob in Human Resources.
不过你知道谁可能会心动？ 人力资源部的鲍伯

Thanks,but I'm not gonna date some random guy from your work.
谢谢你替我打气 但我不要跟某个阿猫阿狗交往

142
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,900
Not random. Bob.
不是阿猫阿狗，是鲍伯

143
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:08,840
It's probably because I'm not mature enough or smart enough...
可能是因为我不够成熟 不够聪明

144
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,300
Maybe he doesn't like the way I dress.
或许他不喜欢我的打扮…

145

No,that can't be it. It's gotta be the smart thing.
不可能的，一定是我不够聪明

and Ross and I have this huge history.

我不懂，你想跟罗斯交往吗？ 不想

00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:48,280
You know,Bob in Human Resources...
人力资源部的鲍伯…

157
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,810
I can't believe you did this! You had me doubting how smart I was!
你居然这样对我 你害我怀疑我的智商

158
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,490
You had me doubting my fashion sense!
你害我怀疑我的穿着品味

159
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:59,620
It's not that big a deal. Just don't date Ross. There's other..
我只是叫你不要跟罗斯约会 世上的男人那么多，你…

160
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,390
You have no right to tell me what to do.
你没有资格教我做事

This is not about me being jealous.

164
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,870
It's about you being a brat, wanting what you can't have.
是你任性，不能吃还想吃

165
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,410
Can't have?

183
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,320

天哪 这是菲比，你在哪里租的？

184
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,990
At the adult video place on Bleecker.
布里克街的成人录影带店

185
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:38,890
And I saw Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him...
我看到乔伊正要进去 就先跑进去..

to surprise him.

This is so bizarre.

193
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,280
I guess it makes sense. She had such a terrible childhood.
不过毕竟她的童年那么悲惨

194
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,780
I had a bad childhood and I don't do porn.

We can't watch it. It's Phoebe.

We shouldn't watch this.

Absolutely not. That goes back.

-Maybe a bit. -The first half?

布非，你要把你的尖棍 深深插进我的体内吗？

00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:02,810
Actually, I was kind of hoping it would be the other way around.
其实我有点希望是你来插

208
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,000
What's that on her ankle?
等等，她的脚踝上是什么？ 

209
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,480
Her ankle is what you're watching?

Well,it's hard to tell.

God,if she would just stop moving.

It's a tattoo.

00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,590
That's weird. Phoebe doesn't..
怪了，菲比没…

216
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,900
Wait,that's Ursula! That's not Phoebe! That is Ursula!
是乌苏拉啦 那不是菲比，是乌苏拉

倒带倒带 我可以看了，快倒带

218
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,840

There's no back to this couch.

You hate this kind of stuff.

I figured I'd give it a shot.
我想试试看

225
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:16,340
One of the stories may make me cry, then you won't think I'm dead inside.
也许有某个故事会让我哭 你就不会觉得我的心死了
