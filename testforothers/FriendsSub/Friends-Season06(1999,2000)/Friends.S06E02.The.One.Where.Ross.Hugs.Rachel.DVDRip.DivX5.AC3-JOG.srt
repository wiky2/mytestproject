-Seriously. -I believe you.
是真的 我相信

144
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:32,600
It was in the middle of a meeting, so no one wants to correct her.
当时正在开员工大会 当然不会有人纠正她

145
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,500
So everyone's calling me Racquel.
于是大家都叫我拉蔻儿

146
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,440
By the end of the day,the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky.
到了下班前 收发室的人已经叫成洛基了

147
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,640
Well,I still think you're very,very nice and very pretty.

And that was so sweet of you to ask.

天哪 我们三个在一起一定会很开心

161
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,950
Yes,we are.

162
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:28,220
Chandler, you'll have to watch those long showers you take...
钱德，你早上不能慢慢冲澡了 

163
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,400
because you know Racquel can't be late.

169
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,820
First marriage: Wife's hidden sexuality. Not my fault.
第一次，老婆隐瞒性向 不是我的错

你们觉得怎样？谁会没兴趣？ 谁会不想和他约会？

And you,Meg?

Normally, he doesn't sweat this much.

She said,"He's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl."
她说 “他显然还爱着这个瑞秋”

这话太扯了 没错，瑞秋是我的好朋友

00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,050
And I have loved her in the past...

but now, she is just my wife.

Phoebe, will you help me out here?

Well, I thought you loved her when you married her.
你娶她时我也以为你爱她

196

We were drunk! I would've married Joey with that amount of alcohol.
我们喝醉了 喝那么多我连乔伊都会娶

197
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,640

比乔伊崔比亚尼烂的人多得是

I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong.

I just don't want to be divorced three times.

200
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,950
Now he's using this three-divorces reason...

201
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,450
because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her.

202
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,160
I must say, well done. Bravo,Meg.

204
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,590
the whole three-divorce thing.
那我就不管了

205
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,140
I'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled.

I am so attracted to him right now.

When will we tell Rachel what actually will happen?

212
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,790
I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got.
我刚才说不出口 你也看到乔伊多难过

What,are Rachel and l not as close as you guys?

286
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,810
and never have I had so much business from one client.
没有一个客户比你捧场

287
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,590
Why don't you tell me what happened?
告诉我怎么回事

288
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:43,290
Basically,Rachel and I were in Vegas,a nd we got drunk.
基本上，瑞秋和我在赌城 我们喝醉了…

00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,860
I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel whose name you said...
抱歉，她就是你上次结婚 

290
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,970
at the altar in the second marriage?

But I do not love her.

293
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,300
That's better then.
这就好多了

294
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:01,210
This was just a drunken mistake, and I need to get it annulled.
这只是酒醉犯错，我要办注销 

295
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,540
I see.
我懂了

296
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,640
Have you considered therapy?
你考虑过接受治疗吗？

297
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:11,350
I think just the annulment for today.
我想今天办注销就好了

298
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,960
-There are some forms to fill out. -Easy.
要填几份表格 简单

299
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:18,630
We'll need witnesses who can testify that you were not of sound mind.
必须有证人证明 你们当时神智不清

300
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,700
No problem.
没问题

301
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:24,130
We'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
你和瑞秋得向法官说明

302
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:30,070
There's no way to do this without her?
不能不找她吗？ 

303
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,210
Because I kind of already told her it was taken care of.
我已经告诉她事情都办妥了

304
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,410
Of course you did.
你当然这么说

305
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,690
Look, you can't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.
罗斯，你和瑞秋都在场 才能办理注销

306
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,650
What about someone who looks like Rachel?

00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,200
I will think about the therapy.
我会考虑接受治疗

308
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:03,240
So I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
我想我们应该开始分东西了

309
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,340
Okay.
好

310
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,780
No point in dragging it out.
没必要拖拖拉拉的

311
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,510
Dragging out the long process of you moving out...

312
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,850
and us not living together anymore.

313
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:15,623
好

315
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,450
What about this? Who gets this?
瑞秋，这个要归谁？

316
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,430
I don't know if I want it because it might be too many memories.
我不知道我想不想要 它有太多回忆

317
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,630
-What is that? -I don't know.
那是什么？ 我不知道

318
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:37,040
How about this? I want you to have the big plate.
瑞秋，大盘子呢？ 我要你留着大盘子

319

Wow, Monica, thanks. I love this plate.
谢谢，我很喜欢这个盘子

320
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,450
Something to remember me by.

321
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,380
Mon, you're not dying. I'm just moving out.
你又不是快死了 我只是要搬出去

322

We're gonna see each other all the time.

But still,it's a big change.
但这是个大转变 

324
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,430
The end of an era, you might say.

325
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,170
Are you okay? You're not blinking.
你还好吗？眼睛都没眨

326
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,570
I'm fine. I was thinking about how it's an end of an era.
我很好 我只是在想一个时代要结束了

327
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,600
Oh,all right.
好吧

328
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,640
But I gotta say, I don't think six years counts as an era.
但老实说 6年应该称不上一个时代

329
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,780
An era is defined as a significant period of time.
一个时代就是一段重要的日子

330
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:23,420
It was significant for me. Maybe it wasn't significant to you!
我觉得重要 或许你不觉得重要

331
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:27,030
-What is the matter with you? -What is the matter with you?!

332
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,020
Why aren't you more upset?
你为什么没有更不开心？ 

333
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,320
Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not living together?
我们要分开了你不难过吗？

334
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,530
Aren't you gonna miss me at all?
你都不会想我吗？

335
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,700
Monica, all right. But don't get mad at me.
好吧，说出来你别生气

336
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,030
It's just a little hard to believe.
我只是有点难以相信 

337
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,210
What's hard to believe?
难以相信什么？

338
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,640
I mean,it's you guys. You do this kind of stuff,you know?
你们啊，你们就是这样

339
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:53,950
You were gonna get married in Vegas, and then you backed out.
你们在赌城说要结婚又不结了

340
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:58,630
I'm not upset because I don't see you going through with it. I'm sorry.
我并不认为你们会真的同居 对不起

342
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,700
It's going to happen.
瑞秋，事情已经确定了

343
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,530
Chandler will move in here.
钱德会搬进来

344
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,640
-But I.. -I know,just let me finish, okay?
但是… 你先听我说完

345
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:16,340
This isn't something that we just impulsively decided to do in Vegas.
这不是在赌城的一时冲动 

346
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,070
This is something that we both really want.

348
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,480
It is?

00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,990
Really?
真的？ 

350
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,080
Yeah,sweetie.

00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:36,760
You mean,we're not gonna live together anymore?
我们不能再住在一起了？

352
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,795
不行了

353
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,200
Oh,my God. I'm gonna miss you so much.
天哪，我会好想你 

354
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,200
I'm gonna miss you.
我也是

355
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,100
I mean, it's the end of an era!

356

I know!

00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,750
-Okay, bye. -Oh,no.

358
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,750
So did you get the annulment?
你去办注销了吗？ 

359
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:04,080
-I couldn't. -I knew it. Because you love Rachel.
我办不了 我就知道，因为你爱瑞秋

360
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,860
It's not that. Annulments are more complicated..
不是那样的 事情比想像中复杂…

361
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,290
Complicated because of the love.
爱让它变得复杂

362
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,360
I do not love Rachel.
我不爱瑞秋

363
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,530
I'm telling her about the whole thing...

so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible.
