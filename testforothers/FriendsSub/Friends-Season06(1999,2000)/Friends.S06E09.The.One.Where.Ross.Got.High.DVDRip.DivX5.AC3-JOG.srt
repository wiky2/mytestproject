00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,710
Chandler laughs at everything.
钱德什么事都笑 

139
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,180
That's one of the great things about him.

140
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,510
Rach,I just remembered.
瑞秋，我刚刚想到

141

I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
我昨晚梦到盖勒先生 

142
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:15,920
Really?

I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building...
对，我梦到他把我从火场救出

and he was so brave and so strong.
他好英勇好强壮

145
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,360
And it's making me look at him totally differently.
我对他完全改观

146
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,730
He used to be just "Jack Geller,Monica and Ross' dad."
他以前只是杰克盖勒 摩妮卡和罗斯的爸爸

147
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,270
Now he's "Jack Geller,dream hunk."
现在他是杰克盖勒，梦中情人

148
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,610
I don't know. To me, he'll always be "Jack Geller...
不知道耶 对我来说他永远都是杰克盖勒

149
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,080
walks in while you're changing."
在你换衣服时闯进来

You know,Dad,Chandler is one of Ross' very best friends.
爸 钱德是罗斯最要好的朋友之一

151

Ross sure is a great guy.

153
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,690
I've always felt that how a man turns out...

154
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,690
is a reflection on his father.
是父亲的翻版

155
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,490
I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?
我也有同感 请问你爸是做什么的？

156
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,060

00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,610
There's drunken dancers a-waiting!
有酒醉的舞者都在等我们

160
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,910
Look at it. Isn't it beautiful?

161
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,450
Yeah. What is it?

then bananas and then I put whipped cream on top.

169
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,640
What was the one right before bananas?

170
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,890
The beef. Yeah,that was weird to me too.
炒牛肉吗？我也觉得有点奇怪

171
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,390
But then I thought, "Well,there's minced-meat pie."
不过我想说连甜肉馅饼都有了

That's an English dessert.

Beef in a dessert?

178
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,270
No,no,no. There is no way.

I know. And only one layer of jam?

Man,now she's gonna start all over.

187
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,680
We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the New World.
我们没办法带那些辣妹 认识新世界了

乔伊，天哪，你家热死了

What's the matter with him?
