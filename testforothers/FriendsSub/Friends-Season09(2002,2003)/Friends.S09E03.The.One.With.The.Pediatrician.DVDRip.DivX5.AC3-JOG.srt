I wonder why Ross said that he died?

但是，天啊，这是千载难逢的好机会

那你说无法忍受每星期四天 要分开，是怎么回事呢？

而如果我们连一天都撑不住 我们真的是有大问题了

00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,240
- I think you should take the job. - Really?
-我认为你应该接受这份工作 -真的吗？

当你开始像猴子一样鬼吼时 我就知道这对你一定很重要

And when I get to Tulsa and people say, "Where's the missus"..
当我去到土尔沙，有人问我 “你老婆呢？”

274
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,160

我会告诉他们，她在杰屋当主厨

275
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,700

然后，当他们 搞不清状况盯着我看时…
