133
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,620
Well, that's spongy.

134
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,160
Hey, handsome.
嘿！我的宝贝儿,

I'll love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you.
我爱死你了！谁家的女孩儿都配不上你！

-We are so lucky. -I know.

He has your eyes.

We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.

-How do you feel? -I'm tired.
-现在感觉如何？ -累啊

143

You don't have that much time to relax. The other one will be along in a minute.
没多少时间可歇了, 下一个马上就出来 

144

I'm sorry, who should be along in a what, now?

The next baby should be along in a minute.

-You know it's twins, right? -Oh, yeah.
-你们知道是双胞胎吧？ -才怪

148
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:01,840
These are the faces of two people in the know.
知道我们俩还能这副表情！

149
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,820
I can't believe you didn't know it's twins. This has never happened before.
怎么可能不知道是双胞胎？ 以前从来没有过的

Did you know it was twins?

152
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,160
It's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic.
是啊, 俄亥俄送过来的文件里面写着呢

153
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,440
-Did anybody tell you? -I don't think so.
-有人告诉过你吗？ -没有啊

154
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:23,670
They did mention two heartbeats, but I thought it was just mine and the baby's.
不过确实提到了两种心跳 我当时觉得应该就是我和孩子的吧

155
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,710
They said, "Both heartbeats are strong."
他们就一直说两个心跳都很强

156
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,280
And I thought, "Well, that's good, because I'm having a baby."
我就觉得不错啊, 因为我正怀着孩子哪

157
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,680
-This is unbelievable. -Twins actually run in my family.

Can I see you for a second?
跟你谈点事

-What do we do? -What do you mean, "What do we do?"
-现在咋办？ -什么咋办？

161
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,460
Twins!

Twins!
双胞胎！

163
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:52,000
-Chandler, you're panicking. -Join me, won't you?
-钱德！你在发抖 -没错！和我一起抖吧！

164
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:57,300
What do you say we keep one and then just have an option on the other one?
我们留一个, 另一个给别人如何?

165
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,100
-We can't split them up. -Why not?
-怎么可以分开啊！ -怎么不行啊！

166
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,440
We could give each of them half a medallion.
给他俩一人半块信物

167
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,280
And then years later, they'll find each other..
数年之后他们凭着信物重逢 

168
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,250
and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody.
大团圆！ 到那时候大家该多开心啊

169
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,520
What if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?
如果领养另一个人的是坏蛋呢？

170
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,670
What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?
要不是呢？要是被某国王领养了呢？

171
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,230
Yeah. Because I hear the king is looking to adopt.
是哈, 听说国王要领养个孩子！

Monica, we are not ready to have two babies.
莫妮卡, 咱俩没想好要两个孩子的

173
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:29,010
That doesn't matter. We have waited so long for this.
又有什么关系！ 咱们等了这么久

174
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,410
I don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies.
我才不管是一个孩子还是两个孩子！ 仨孩子都没关系！

175
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,310
I don't care if the entire cast of Eight Is Enough comes out of there.
生出《八宝喜事》全剧组来都没关系！

176
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,320
We are taking them home because they are our children.
一定要把他们带回家 因为他们是咱们的孩子啊 

177

Well, now we have one of each.
现在一男一女了！

185
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,840
And that's enough.

186
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:15,080
And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.
后来她说那个是最好的告别方式

187
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:18,790
Oh, my God. What did you say?
天哪, 你说什么了？

-什么都没说 能说什么啊？ -罗斯！一定要告诉她你的感受啊！

-No way. -Well, you can't just give up.
-不行！ -不能就这么放弃她啊！

190
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,600
Is that what a dinosaur would do?
恐龙会这么做吗？

191
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,910
-What? -I'm just trying to speak your language.
-啥？ -我就是想用你们的语言和你说来着

Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you even wanna get back together.

But they must've jumped off the table. Now they're gone!
一定是从桌子上跳下去了, 现在都不见了啊！

380
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,580
Don't worry, we'll find them.
别着急, 慢慢找

381
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,220
Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.
我去看孩子去了

382
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,510
Oh, God! What did I just step on?
啊!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 我刚才踩着什么了！

383
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:11,620
It's okay. It's just an egg roll.
没事了, 就是个蛋卷

384
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:15,060
You stepped on my egg roll?!
你竟敢踩着我的蛋卷！

385
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,420
I'm sorry. I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor.
抱歉, 谁会想到地上会有中国菜！

386
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,220
Just put it on a plate and leave.
放到盘子里, 然后快走

387
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,930
-Okay. Let's find these birds. -All right.
-好了. 开始找吧 -好

388
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,740
Wait, wait. You hear that?
等等！听到了没？ 

389
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:40,550
-They're in the table! -Well, that can't be good.
-啊！在桌子里！ -这可不妙了！

390
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,710
-We gotta get them out of there! -How?
-必须要取出来！ -怎么取？！

391
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,580
Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?
也许能引诱他们出来, 你知道鸟怎么叫吗？

392
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:48,450
Oh, tons. I'm quite the woodsman.
当然了, 我就是干伐木工的

393
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,930
Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.
把桌子一头抬起来点也许管用

394
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,930
Joey, wait! The ball!
乔伊等一下！球还没...

395
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,320
So, what do we do?
现在怎么办！！

396
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,450
Maybe we can open this up somehow.
不清楚……也许边上什么地方能打开吧

397
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,250
Okay.
好

398
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,090
No. It's all glued together.
不行啊, 都粘上了

399
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,290
Does that mean we have to bust it open?
也就是说要……硬撬开？

400
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,260
-I don't know. Maybe. -Oh, my God.
-不知道……也许吧 -天哪！

401
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,930
I know. It's.. It's the foosball table.
我明白……这可是足球桌啊

402
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,440
All right, you know what? We don't have a choice.
没有办法了 

403
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:43,550
It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd have gotten the part.
就像我在一部科幻电影里面的台词一样, 如果我当初赢到角色的话……

404
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,880
Those are our men in there, and we have to get them out..
“里面有人！必须要救出来！”

405
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:51,060
even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life..
“即使要牺牲我生命中最重要的东西--

406
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,630
my time machine.
我的时间机器……”

407
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:57,660
-Did that movie ever get made? -It did not.
-这电影拍出来了没？ -根本没拍……

408
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:04,670
Jack Weinberg, white courtesy phone. Jack Weinberg.

00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,170
-Ross, where are you going? -To talk to Rachel.
-罗斯！你去哪里？ -去找瑞秋啊 

410
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,000
Isn't that why we took a ride in the death cab?
所以我才坐死亡计程车来的

411
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,010
You're walking up to her at the gate?
你就直接去登机口？ 

412
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,840
Have you never chased anyone through the airport before?
以前在没在机场追过人？！

413
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:17,350
Not since my cop show got canceled.
我的警察戏镜头被取消之后就没有过了……

414
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,850
You have to get a ticket to get past security.
必须先买票才能通过安检

415
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:25,010

-那就赶不及了啊！ -保持这种气势！快滚过来！

Okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great.
大家再走慢点就好了

417
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,770
-Madame, your passport, please. -Oh, my God.
-（法式英语）小姐, 看一下您的护照？ -天哪！ 

418
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,670
I was afraid I wouldn't remember my high school French.
我还害怕高中学的法语都忘干净了呢！

419
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,680
But I understood every word you just said.

-Madame, if you don't have your.. -I have it, I have it!
-小姐, 如果您没有…… -我有我有我有我有！！！

423
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,130
Okay, I can't find it, but I remember that I was in seat 32C..
哎呀, 找不到, 不过我清楚记得 我的座位号是32 C 

424
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,930
because that's my bra size.
因为我罩杯号就是这个 

425
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,530
You must have your boarding pass..
-小姐, 您必须要有登机牌, 否则……

426
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,110
You know what? If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem.
告诉你, 我要是36 D, 就没这么多麻烦了！

427
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,420
-Hi. I need a ticket. -Just one?
-您好, 我要买一张票 -就买一张？

428
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,420
I drive you here, and I don't get to see how it works out?
我开车这么大老远送你过来 不能看看结局啥样？

I'm so lucky I married you.

啊！找到了找到了！哈！ 找到了！早和你说了我有！

440
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,670
