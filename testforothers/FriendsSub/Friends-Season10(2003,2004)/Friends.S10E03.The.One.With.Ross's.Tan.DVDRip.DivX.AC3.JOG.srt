呃，我已经拒绝让她来了！ 我不能拒绝她两次！

我……只是有点奇怪，是你和我

Well, this is romantic.

I'm sorry. This has never happened to me before.
对不起！ 这种事从来没有发生在我身上！

156
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,520
I'm an expert at taking off bras. I could do it with one hand.
我是解胸罩的专家！ 我一只手就能解开！

157
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,750
I could do it with my eyes closed. Once I just looked at one..
我闭着眼睛也行！ 有一次我只看了一眼

158
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,120
and it popped open.
它自己就开了！

159

- I blame your bra. - It's a standard-issue bra clasp.
- 都怪你的胸罩！ - 这是个标准型的胸罩搭扣！

那就怪你！对！ 是你把我的天赋都打走了！

好吧，我真的 真的很抱歉，乔伊！

162
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:02,870
But do you think maybe, on some level, you don't want to take off my bra?
可你想过吗？ 可能是你潜意识里不想脱掉我的胸罩？

163
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,510
No, I don't have another level.
啊！我没有那种潜意识！！

164

Oh, dear God.

00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,530
Hold on. There's something different.

I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.

Oh, and it gets worse.
哦！比那还糟！

170
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:54,090
Oh, my God, you can do a duet of "Ebony and lvory" all by yourself.
哦，天呐！ 你一个人就能同时表现黑檀木和象牙!

171
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,420
How could you mess this up? It's so easy.
你怎么能搞成这样？ 这很容易呀！

172
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,360
You go in the booth, count to five and turn around.
你进到小隔间里 数到五，转身！！

What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?

How was your date with Joey?
你和乔伊的约会怎么样？

178
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:22,980
Well, it was good, until we got back to our apartment.
嗯，还不错…… 至少在我们回家之前

179
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,820
And then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg..
后来我们就搞砸了 他把手放在我的腿上

180
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,620
and I kept slapping it away.

You didn't like that?
你不喜欢？

182
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,970
Well, it wasn't just me, all right? He freaked out too.
嗯，不光是我，明白吗？ 他也出问题了！

He couldn't even undo my bra.
他甚至解不开我的胸罩！

184
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:40,510
Really? One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open.
哇，真的？有一次 他只看了我的胸罩一眼，它就自己嘣开了。

185
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,140
I do not know what's wrong with us.
我不知道我们怎么了

186
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,650
We've kissed before and that's been great.
我是说 我们以前接吻过，那很好！

187
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,920
But this time it was leading somewhere..

Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?
嗨，钱德 我能跟你谈谈吗？

好吧，我很抱歉搞砸了那个隔离她的计划。 不过我有了个新计划。

哦！ 那，什么紧急的事情能把我们两个人都叫走呢？
