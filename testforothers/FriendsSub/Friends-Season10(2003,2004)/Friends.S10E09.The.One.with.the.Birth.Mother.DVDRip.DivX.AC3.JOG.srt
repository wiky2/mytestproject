Joey doesn't share food!
乔伊从不分享食物!!!

135
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,710
Well, I still think that is a stupid reason not to call someone again.
我坚持, 因为这条破事就 放弃好女孩很不明智

136
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,140
You are calling her, okay?
你再约她, 如果有必要

137

And if you need to, then just get an extra plate of fries for the table.
干脆再点一盘薯条不就完了?

Three hundred and fifty dollars?

00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:06,730
Down from 700. You're saving, like,200 bucks.
从700块打折下来!你差不多省了200块!

I know what looks sexy on guys.
我知道男人穿什么最性感

So you're saying..
你是说…

178
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,950
if I wear these pants, I might be getting into hers?
我若穿这条裤子，她会允许我侵犯?

179
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,390
Why do men keep talking to me like this?
为什么男人老跟我来这套?

180
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,600
So the fact that I'm a doctor and my wife's a reverend..
我是医生, 我太太是牧师, 

181
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,240
that's important to you?
这对你很重要?

182
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,340
Yeah. I read some great applications..
是啊, 很多申请人都很优秀

183
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,570
but I thought, "Who better than a minister to raise a child?"
但是, 带孩子谁也比不上牧师

184
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,300
Amen.
阿门

185
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:27,670
Plus, I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor.
何况还有医生的妙手

186
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,410
Good hands.
很好的一双手。

187
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,640
Healing hands.
疗伤圣手

188
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,190
Reverend, can I ask? Does the Bible say anything about adoption?
牧师, 圣经上有写领养孩子吗?

189
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,330
It says, "Do it."
写了:但做无妨!

190
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:44,860
"And behold, she did adopt unto them a baby.
(模仿圣经句式:)她让他们领养了一个婴孩 (原为"你要怀孕生子，可以给他起名叫耶稣")

191
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,030
And it was good."
(继续:)此乃善举

192
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:53,670
-Wow. -Yeah, wow.
-哇 -我也哇

193
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,940
I was wondering.. You both have such serious jobs.
我在想 你们工作都责任重大

194
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,210
Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?
有时间照顾BB? 还兼顾你的教友们?

195
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,410
-My flock? -People in your church.
-我的教友？ -你们教堂里的人。

196
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,180
Oh, my flock.
哦，我的教友。

197
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,850
Oh, no, my flock? My flock is good.
我的教友? 我的教友们很不错

198
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,290
Yeah. My flock pretty much takes care of themselves by this point.
现在他们能照顾自己

199
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,720
Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.
好教友，好教友

200
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,560
But being a doctor, that must take up a lot of time.
当医生很花时间吧?

201
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:22,460
Not for me it doesn't.
我的情况不同

202
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,730
So how's everything going in here?
谈得如何?

203
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,530
We're great. I think I may have asked all my questions.
问题问完了，很满意

204
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,570
Good. Do you have questions for Erica?
你们有什么要问她?

205
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,480
Yeah, actually. So you read a file that you liked..
我想问问, 你读到满意的申请表

206
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:37,280
and then you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?
然后告诉代理人编号 然后他们联系到我们?

207
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,750
Yes. Our system ensures total anonymity.
我们的系统中用户完全匿名

208
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,950
-We're very proud of it. -You should be.
-我们以此为荣 -应该骄傲

209
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,490
You're really on top of stuff.
一流

210
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:50,320
Well then, if there's nothing else, then the two of us should talk.
别的没什么了?那我们俩谈谈

211
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,060
I actually..
实际上…

212
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,500
-I don't think we have to. -We don't?
-我想我们不必谈了 -为什么不？

213
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,930
Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty sure I wanted you..
我看了你们的 档案就确定要选你们

214
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,730
but I just thought we should meet face to face.
但还想当面见见你们

215
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,100
I've made my decision.
我决定了, 就选他们

216
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,170
I choose them.

Oh, my God, this is great.

-We got some really great stuff. -Yeah.

224
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,490
Yeah, but I'm not sure about some of the bras I got.
但是，有些胸罩似乎不妥

225
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,300
Really? Do you want to try some of them on for me?
真的?你能穿上试给我看吗？

226
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,810

227
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,710
Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?
等一下，我们是在乔伊的幻想里?

Oh, no. I took one of Ross' bags by mistake.
糟糕, 错拿罗斯一袋

229
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,350
And one of mine is missing.
我那件不见了

230
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,890
Ross probably has it. You'll get it from him later.
肯定在罗斯那里, 找他拿回来好了

231
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,960
So, what do you think?
如何?

232
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,430
I think we're not wearing the same shirt anymore.

233
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,640
Yeah. Yeah, Rachel picked it out for me.
对，瑞秋帮我选的

她让我相信她 真高兴我答应了, 一路回头率暴高!

I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
在来的路上, 有很多人看我

Somebody's afraid of a little competition with the ladies?

Looks like someone is the ladies!

-We are not signing those papers. -Why not?
-不能签 -为啥?

回想一下，我其实满像牧师

250
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:14,600
I mean, as a chef, I serve God by feeding the hungry and poor.
作为厨子, 我给饥饿的人和穷人提供食物 这不也是为上帝服务?

得了, 机会敲门

不如将错就错, 他们都在签协议了

We may not be who she thinks we are..

-I know. -I mean, who knows..
-我明白 -我的意思是

260
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,830
how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby?
