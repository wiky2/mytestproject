00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,850
Benji?
Benji?

369
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:01,890
All right. It's true. I behaved horribly, but it's only because I still love you.
是的，的确是这样。我之前简直是乱来。 但这都是因为我还爱着你。

370
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:05,000
And I would do anything to have you back in my life.
只要你回到我身边，我可以做任何事。

371
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,830
Too little, too late, Benji.
太少了，太迟了，Benji！

372
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:13,030
- I can't believe this. - I never should've broken up with you.
-我不敢相信。 -我真不应该离开你

373
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:18,230
I think about you all the time. Do you ever still think about me?
我无时无刻不想起你。 难道你一点都没有想起我?

374
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,900
No.
没有!

375
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,110
- Yes. - What?
-有! -什么?

376
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,880
I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so..
我不知道该说什么好了，Benji。 这一切实在太...

377
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:30,110
romantic.
浪漫了

378
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,150
Or?
或者...

379
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,090
I know I may be way out of bounds here..
我知道，或者我做得太过火了

380
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,720
but is there any chance you would take me back?
但我们还有机会在一起吗？

381
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,400
Maybe.
或者可以...

382
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:49,470
Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.
甜心，你们的对话让我觉得有点不舒服了。

383
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,910
Oh, God. I am so sorry, but..
噢 天啊！我很抱歉，但...

384
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,850
I mean, there's so much history between us, you know?
我是说...我们之前有太多的过去了...

385
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,520
I'm sorry too.
我也觉得抱歉...

386
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,290
- I love you. - I love you too.
-我爱你! -噢! 我也爱你!

387
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:19,330
Okay, that's it, we are seeing other people.
好了, 够了。我们算是完了！

388
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,080
Gladys?
格拉达斯?

389
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:50,900
For the third time this week. Man, this does not get old.
哈哈哈，这个星期的第三次了。 老兄，你怎么还没长大啊？

390
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:56,210
- You're mean! - Oh, don't be such a baby. Please.
-你真可恶！ -不要这么孩子气啦！

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
