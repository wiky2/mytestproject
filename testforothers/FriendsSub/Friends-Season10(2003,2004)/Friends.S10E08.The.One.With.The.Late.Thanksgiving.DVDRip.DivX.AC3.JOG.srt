-Hi. -Hey.
-嗨！ -嗨！

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,930
We need to talk about something.
啊，有点事和你们谈谈。

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,160
Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
我们觉得... 今年我们不能再作东感恩节晚餐了。

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,930
-What? -Are you kidding?
-什么，什么？ -什么，你是在开玩笑吧

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,010
Well, it's just with work and the stress of adoption..
嗯，由于工作，还有领养孩子的压力

7
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,040
we don't feel like we have the energy.
我们只是觉得没有精力弄了。

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,580

That's Monica talking.

-No, we made this decision together. -She's putting words in your mouth.
-不，不，这是我们两个人的决定！ -这一定是她的意思！  （英文直译：莫尼卡把话语放在了钱德勒的嘴里）

12
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:38,960
Don't you put words in people's mouths. You put turkey in people's mouths.
你不应该把话送到我们口中 而是把火鸡送到我们口中……

13
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,590
I can't believe this. This is Emma's first Thanksgiving.
无法相信 这可是艾玛的第一个感恩节！

-谢谢，菲比。 -不客气, 这样倒好

还有，去年的晚餐真好啊 她已江郎才尽，今年不会更好了。

18
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:03,950
-What? You are way off, lady. -Am I? Really? Am I?
-什么？你搞错了，女士！ -是么？

19
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:07,560
Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong.
那你就再弄一次，证明我错。

20
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,430
Well, think about it. You'd be trying to top what you did last year.
你想想 你是在试图超过去年的顶峰

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,690
You'd be in competition with yourself.

22
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,870
That's my favorite kind.

Okay, we are doing this.

Don't let yourself get manipulated this way.
别让自己这么容易被左右。

25
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,940
Stay out of this, Chandler. This is between me and me.
不关你的事，钱德 这是我和……“我”之间的事情！

26
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,280
We are supposed to make these decisions together.
我们应该一起决定啊！

27
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,250
Did you not watch the Dr. Phil I taped for you?
还记得费勒医生说的么？

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,550

菲比，难道我们只是为了一个奖杯

00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,420
What?
什么？

123
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,820
She's gonna look washed-out next to the others.
她应该比其他孩子看起来更漂亮！

124
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,420
No, I'm not letting you put makeup on my baby.
菲比，我不会让你给我的孩子化妆的！

125
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,820
-Why not? -Because I already did.
-为什么不？ -因为我已经给她化过了！

126
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:31,830
You suck! Get off the ice, you idiot!
鲍伯，干掉那家伙！

127
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,270
-What a game. -I know. Yeah.
-太精彩了！ -没错，耶！

128
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,670
-I can't believe Chandler's missing this. -I'm sorry he's not here.
-真遗憾钱德错过了这场比赛！ -我也替他觉得遗憾

129
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:42,980
But I gotta say, I am really enjoying nacho chair.
但我要说的是，我真的很喜欢这个“玉米片”座！

130
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:47,520
Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.
嗯，要是你不总是把我的手打开， 我可能也会吃不少呢

131
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,920
-Yeah! -These seats are great.
-哦！ -这位置太棒了！

132
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,080
I know, I know. When I was here for "Holidays on lce"..
是啊，没错！ 上次假期我在这看比赛，座位太远了

133
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,260
I was sitting so far away, Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner.
关颖珊（花样滑冰世界冠军）根本就看不到我举的条幅。

134
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,230
Dude, I'm sure she knows you heart her.
老兄, 我认为她知道你心里有她

135
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,470
I hope so.
希望吧

136
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,870
We'd better get going. If we don't leave now, we're gonna be late.
嘿，我们该走了啦，回去吃饭。

137
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,670
But it's a tie game. So we're a little late. The girls will be there.
可比赛太精彩了！ 我们可以晚回去点吧，女生们应该准时的

138
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,910
Let's just stay for one more goal.
再进一个球再走啦

139
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,610
-I don't know. -One more fight.
-不好吧.. -再进攻一轮？

140
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,720
-Okay. -Okay.
-好吧。 -好吧。

141
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,660
Where is everybody? They're 45 minutes late.
大家都哪里去了？他们迟到了45分钟！

142
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:30,890
I can't believe they're not here. I slave and I slave for what?
我不相信他们会不来！我辛苦了一天 而我这么辛苦是为了什么？

143
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,470
They've ruined Cranberry Day.
他们毁了我的酸梅日！

144
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,770
-How late are we? -Forty-five minutes.
-我们迟到了多久？ -45分钟

145
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,240
-Here. -Okay.
-给. -好的.

146
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:44,270
Rachel and Phoebe are already there, so they probably started without us.
瑞秋和菲比应该已经到了 也就是说她们应该已经开始了

147
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,680
We could just slip in, and no one needs to know where we were.
让我们溜进去，这样谁都不会注意我们的。

148
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,950
-You may want to lose the foam finger. -Oh, no, no, no.
-你不把这个泡沫大手指扔掉么？ -哦，才不呢！

You just want to put it on your hand.
我知道你想抢走他！

150
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,760
-You're not at Thanksgiving? -No, we're late.
-你们没在里面？ -不，我们迟到了！

151
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,160
-What are you doing here? -We're late too.
-你们在这里干什么？ -我们也迟到了！

152
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,060
We figured we could be late because you'd be on time.
我们本以为你们不会迟到的！

153
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,330
Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani.
别用这个指着我，崔比阿尼！

154
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,940
-Nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us. -Yeah, where were you?
-那...里面没人，莫尼卡会杀了我们的！ -你们到什么地方去了？

155
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,510
-Well.. -Yeah, what's with the trophy?
-啊… -那是什么奖杯？

156
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,170
Well, we were at a spelling bee.
嗯，我们去参加拼字大赛了。

157
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,180
And I won.
我赢了！

158
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,910
You won an adult Thanksgiving Day spelling bee?
你在感恩节这天 赢得了一场成人拼字游戏？

159
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,690
Yes. Y-E-S. Yes.
是-的, 是的！

160
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:39,270
Let me see this. "Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division"?
让我看看…… 超级小可爱，纽约区。

161
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,900
That's me.
那便是我！

162
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,500
You entered Emma in a beauty pageant?
你们让艾玛参加了选美比赛？

163
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:50,700
And it looks like she put makeup on her.
而且还给她化了妆！

164
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:55,040
Wait a second. Where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before?
等等，等等 我好像在什么地方见过这身牛仔...

165
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,610
I can't believe this. She's our daughter.
无法置信，她是我们的女儿！

166
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:02,480
That you would treat her like some kind of show dog is inexcusable.
你把她当成观赏狗一样，不可饶恕

167
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,680
-She won a thousand dollars. -So this is an annual thing?
-她为我们赢得了一千美元！ -啊，是一年一次的吗……

168
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:13,230
That's Alicia May Emory's outfit!
啊，这是Alicia Mae的装备！

169
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,730
Guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier.
伙计们，有人在里面要发火了！

170
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,530
-What are we gonna do? -I gotta put Emma down for a nap.
-天哪，我们该怎么办？ -我不知道，你们想吧, 我先把艾玛送回去。

171
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:25,010
And, Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia May.
哦，瑞秋，至少给个主意吗

172
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,710
-All right, what are we gonna say? -We'll say that we were mugged.
-我们该怎么说？ -我们可以说，我们被抢劫了

173
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,550
You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged.
当有人被抢了的时候，是不能生气的！

174
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,920
Good. But you don't look like you were mugged.
嗯，不错，但你看起来不像被抢过。

175
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,350
No. Here.
不像..这样才像

176
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,290
Hey!
嘿！

177
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,760
Do you hear something?

00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:56,010
-They're out there. -Let me see.
-他们都在外面！ -让我看看！

179
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,280
I can't believe this. They're an hour late, and they're just standing there talking.
我真没办法相信，他们迟到了一小时 还在那里聊天！

180
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:07,290
Everything's so distorted. It looks like Joey has a giant hand.
一切都乱套了，乔伊有只大手！

181
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,780
That says "Rangers" on it. They went to the game.
上面写“游骑兵”，他们去看比赛了！

182
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:15,630
Oh, they are in for a world of pain.
哦，这太可怕了！

183

-Ross' shirt is torn. -They're late and they're sloppy.
-罗斯的衬衫撕坏了。 -他们不但迟到，而且衣衫不整！

184
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,270
All right, Emma's napping. What happened to your shirt?
好了，艾玛睡下了。你的衬衫怎么了？

185
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:30,310
I got mugged, and they stole my pocket.
我被抢了，他们还偷走了我的钱包。

186
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,410
We're just trying to figure out an excuse.
瑞秋，我们是在找借口。

187
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,810
How about this?
好吧，想想

188
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:41,320
We could say that Monica told us 5:00, not 4:00. That way we're right on time.
我们可以说，莫尼卡告诉我们是5点 而不是4点，所以我们没迟到，我们是准时的！

189
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:47,860
Or we could plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.
或者, 我们可以在房间里放些迷药，布个局！

190
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,090
That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
嗯，这的确是个下迷药的好办法。

191
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,260
We'll just say that she said it was 5:00.
你可以就说她说的是5点

192
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,170
We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time.
做得自然些 所以我们根本没有迟到！

193
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:08,200
"We know you're out there."
“我们知道你们在外面。”

194
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,320
Who do you think it's from?
你觉得这是谁写的？

195
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,020
Oh, God, this is bad. This is so bad.
哦，太糟了，太糟了。

196
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,490
Well, let's just go in there and face them.
好吧，让我们进去面对他们吧。

197
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,860
I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.
我不要先进去 莫尼卡生气的面孔会让我发疯的。

198
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:30,900
I hate that thing. It's like a bolt of lightning.
嗯，我也不要 那张脸就像扭曲的闪电一样……

199
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:35,100
Why don't we play Rock, Paper, Scissors, and whoever loses, goes in first.
嘿，我有主意了 我们可以玩石头剪子布，输了的先进去！

200
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,840
-All right, I'm in. -Ready.

201

I win.

00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,110
-What is that? -That's fire. It beats everything.
-这是什么？ -火焰，赢过一切！

203
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:51,350
Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon?
真的么？能赢过一个水球么？

204
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:56,750
Well-played, Phoebe Buffay. Well-played.
好极了，菲比，玩得真好。

-It's locked. -What? Oh, sure, now they lock it.
-锁住了！ -哈，他们把门锁上了

208
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,400
When they're having sex on the couch, it's like:
等他们在躺椅上 准备嘿咻的时候，他们就会说

209
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,880
"Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy!"
“啊，快进来，快进来，我等不了了！”

210
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,710
All right, come on. All right, you guys, we're so sorry we're late.
好吧。伙计们，你们怎么样啊？ 很抱歉我们迟到了

Please let us in so we can have dinner together.
让我们进去一起吃晚餐吧！

不，东西都凉了 火鸡干了，馅也松了！

说谎！你们去看比赛了 我能看到乔伊的手！

让我们进去吃美味的火鸡吧！

大伙, 最好听她的 她的血管涨到前所未有的大

Oh, my God, it's Brussels sprouts!

That's worse than no food.

我不觉得这是个好主意 他们明显不想和我们在一起。
