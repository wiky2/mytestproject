16
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,500
Which could've used a little more mustard.
不过应该多加些芥末

当然了！再过6个月我的禁令就过期了 

121
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,590
and I can travel internationally again.
到时候我又可以作国际旅行了 

122
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,900
-I'm gonna miss you so much. -I know.
-我一定会很想你的！ -我也是 

123
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,760
You know what? I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say..
你知道么, 我对你们每个人都有些告别的话要说 

124
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:35,070
to each of you. I was gonna save it till the end of the night, but come here.
我本来打算在结束的时候说的, 但是...跟我来 

125
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,000
Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?
嘿, 你们说她们到屋里去干吗？

126
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,940
If I had to guess, I'd say..
嗯, 照我看来 

127
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,750
Rachel's putting on the bubble wrap, and Phoebe's doing the punching.
肯定是瑞秋戴上塑料泡沫, 然后菲比来动手打 

128
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,490
Phoebe, I don't even know where to start.
哦, 菲比, 我真不知道应该怎么开口 

129
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,760
Okay, well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you presents..
嗯, 这样吧 我知道今天本来不需要给你准备礼物的

130
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,260
but I do have something for you.
但我还是准备了一个 

131
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,430
-What is it? -Well, it's a cotton swab..
-哦, 哦, 这是什么？ -是一个棉花棒 

132
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,370
with a bit of my saliva on it..
上面沾了些我的口水 

133
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,800
so that if they perfect the cloning process while you're over there..
这样一来 如果你在巴黎的时候发现那边的克隆技术成熟了

134
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,210
you can use the DNA to create your own Phoebe.
你就可以用这上面的DNA来另外做一个菲比

135
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,180
I'm gonna throw this away..
啊...我可能会把这个扔掉...

136
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,690
but thank you so much for the gesture.
但是我很感谢你这份心意...

137
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,660
Chandler?
钱德？

138
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:33,020
I was just in our bedroom, and I found these on my pillow.
我刚才在卧室的枕头上发现了这个？

139
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,690
Oh, yes, I decided to leave those out for you in case Richard stops by..
哦, 我决定把这个先给你留着  万一哪天Richard过来

140
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:41,100
and you want to engage in a little light bondage and mustache play.
你可以跟他的胡子一起玩 

141
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,340
What? These aren't mine.
你说什么呢？这不是我的！

142
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,840
Oh, yeah, right!
啊？是吗？

143
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,950
Good luck getting another scarf dance from me.
以后休想再让我给你跳领带舞了！

144
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,490
That would be a terrible punishment.
这种“惩罚”太可怕了...

145
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,420
But I'm serious, I've never seen these before.
我是说真的 我以前从来没见过这东西 

146
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:59,620
Really? Then what are they doing in our guest room?
真的吗？那它怎么会出现在我们的客房里的？

147
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,760
Rachel used to live in that room.
瑞秋曾经在那里住过 

148
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:05,520
Rachel. With handcuffs.
瑞秋...戴着手铐... 

149
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,460
Interesting.

Please don't..
你可千万...千万...

155
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,320
Don't turn into, you know, a French bitch.
别...别变成一个...法国婊子...

156
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,690
I won't.

157
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,400
All right. Well, if I'm gonna do this, I better keep going.
我得继续找其他人了 

158

159
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,400
-Monica? -Yeah?

00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,540
-Will you come with me for a minute? -Sure.
-跟我进来一下好吗？ -当然

161
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,510
-Are you wearing waterproof mascara? -No.

162
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,740

163
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,550
Hey.
嘿 

164
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,020
What was that all about?
这是怎么回事？

165
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,690
She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.
她打算跟我们每个人单独告别 

166
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,490
Are you kidding? Oh, my God.
哦, 开什么玩笑, 天哪！

167
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,220
Yeah, I know. It's gonna be even worse for you. God.
是啊, 我知道, 轮到你的时候可能会更糟 

168
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,990
Well, just get ready to do some serious crying.
天哪, 准备好好大哭一场吧 

169
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,590
Man, I'm not gonna be able to handle this.
天哪, 我怕我会撑不过去...

170
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:22,730
Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year.
我现在终于知道每个学期末我的学生们的感受了 

171
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,410
And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.
我猜他们是因为太舍不得我了 所以才会（在教师评定中）给我打那么低的分数 

172
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,450
Mon. Okay.
莫妮卡, 好吧

173

I better just say what it is I'm gonna say.
我就直说了 我想说的是...

174
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,760
None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last 10 years..
如果没有你, 我在过去十年里

175
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,200
would have happened if it wasn't for you.
我不可能会这么幸福

No one has been more like a sister to me.

You're like a sister to me too.

Oh, no, she took down Monica.
哦, 她连莫妮卡都搞定了

187

And I'm the crier in the family.
要知道 在盖勒家我是最爱哭的 

188
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,790
Oh, God, I could be next.
哦, 天哪, 可能该轮到我了 

189
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,600
Maybe she won't talk to me if it looks like we're deep in conversation.
如果我跟你说话, 她可能就不选我了 

190
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,030
Oh, so that thing you said about the thing..

it really made me think about that other thing.
让我想起了那个什么 

192
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,600

-瑞秋？ -好了, 看起来钱德找上她了

I really made you think about that thing, huh?
你想起了哪个什么啊？

194
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:09,750
Rach, I think I have something that belongs to you.
瑞秋, 我想这个应该是你的吧？

I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.
哈, 你的笑话又来了 每次我都得逼着自己乐  我将来一定会怀念这种感觉

No, no, they're really yours. We found them in your old room.
不, 不, 这真的是你的  我们是在你住过的房间里找到的

198
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,730
Don't say Richard.
别提Richard!

199

Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?
如果这不是莫妮卡的, 也不是你的, 那是谁的呢？

I think these are yours.

这不是我的! 这么松松垮垮的

My God, you try to hang a guy from a water pipe with these..
如果你用这个把人栓在水管上面

-我能单独跟你谈谈么？ -当然

一旦我觉得不自然 可能又该开始开无聊的玩笑了

你知道, 也许她和我们讲话花费不少体力

249
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,190
-It was pretty intense. -Yeah, mine too.
-真是非常的热烈啊 -对啊, 我的也是

250

-Mine was a humdinger. -Okay!
-我的很了不起 -没错

251
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,730
All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's gotta be an explanation.
我们好好想想, 肯定是有什么原因的 

252
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,900
-Did you do anything to make her mad? -No, I don't think so.
-你是不是惹她生气了？ -没有啊 

253
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:32,740
You didn't, say, borrow her Girls Gone Wild video and never return it?
那你有没有借她的"Girls Gone Wild"录影带 而且又不还

254
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,710
Really? Now?
真的? 现在?

255
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:41,250
I mean, don't I deserve anything? I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug?
我是说, 我真的那么无足轻重吗？ 哪怕是几滴眼泪, 一个简单的拥抱...

256
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,720
Not from you!
不是跟你抱！

257
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,760
Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.
罗斯, 如果你这么在意, 你应该去跟她直说 

258
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,360
And say what? You owe me a goodbye?
说什么啊？说“你还没跟我告别呢”？

-I mean, he's got more pride than that. -The hell I do!
-他的自尊心往哪儿放？ -什么自尊心, 见鬼去吧

260
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,270
-I don't get a goodbye? -What?
-连再见都不跟我说？ -什么？

261
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,740
Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What do I gotta do to get a goodbye?
你跟其他人都告别过了, 为什么没有我？ 到底要我做什么你才舍得跟我说句再见？

262
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:10,010
Be best friends with you? Go out with you?
和你做好朋友？和你约会？ 

263

Have a baby with you?

264
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,090
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute! I did all those things!
哦, 等一下, 等一下, 这些我好像都做过！

265
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,680
-Ross.. -Or maybe I'm just not giving you..
-罗斯   -哦, 也许我应该体谅你一下 

266
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:22,520
enough credit. I mean, it is difficult to say goodbye to five people.
也许连续跟五个人说再见是太困难了一点, 嗯...

267
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,560
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, g..
再见, 再见, 再见, 再见, 再...

268
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,600
It's physically impossible!
哦, 简直不可能啊！！！

269
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,140
You know what? After all we've been through..
你知道么, 我们这么多年的感情

270
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,570
I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us.
我真没想到这就是你想要的结局 

271
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,040
Have a good time in Paris.
祝你在巴黎一切顺利 

272
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,980
Rach, I know this may not be the best time..
瑞秋, 我知道现在可能不是最佳时机.

273
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:52,290
but Joey's going over the balcony again. Could you just come talk to him?
但是乔伊又去阳台了, 你能过来和他谈谈吗?

274
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,760
-I hope Ross isn't too upset. -I'm sure he's not more bummed out..
-我希望罗斯不会太沮丧  -我肯定  

275
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,960
-than I am. -Tell me about it.
-我比他难过  -谁说不是呢 

276
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,040
Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.
看来我们的聚会办得不错！

277
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:09,000
I think I'm gonna head out.
我要撤了 

278

-你打算去哪儿？ -我打算回家睡觉 

279
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,970
but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.
不过现在我感觉到有人要逼我留下来了 

280
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,880
We're moving, and we got a lot of packing to do.
我们马上就要搬家了, 有很多东西需要收拾 

281

-如果你们能来帮忙就太好了  -乔伊和我可以继续收拾客房

Yeah, good idea.
是啊, 是啊, 好主意 

283

You couldn't be cool.
你就不会装得冷静一点 

285
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,090
We're gonna start in the kitchen.
好的, 让我们从厨房开始 

286
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:40,400
Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked 10 to a box.
首先盘子放在盘套里, 然后十个一组装箱

-Yeah. -Good. I need you to be careful..
-明白了  -好 , 你们要小心一点

同时动作要快 记住, 如果我朝你们叫唤...

it is only because you're doing it wrong.
