-好吧, 这太难了, 我教不了你！ -你干吗？

127
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,190
I have to go before I put your head through a wall.
我得走了, 不然我要拿你的头撞墙了！

128
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,190
Don't go, I need you! My audition is tomorrow!
不, 别走, 我需要你  我明天就要面试了！

嘿, 我本来想做晚饭的

130
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,990
but all I found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream.
但是你爸的冰箱里只有熏肉和奶油 

131
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,020
I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.
我想我们找到他得心脏病的原因了

-What? -I just can't believe..

135
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,160
I'm in Rachel Green's room.
我在瑞秋格林的房间里 

136
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,030
-You've been in my room before. -Yeah, sure, right.
-你什么意思？你以前到过我的房间  -对, 当然, 没错 

137
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,570
Like I'd ever be in Rachel Green's room.
就跟我真来过瑞秋格林房间似的 

138
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,150
Okay, I gotta tell you, it's really weird when you use my whole name.
好吧, 我得跟你说 你叫我的全名可真有点儿怪 

139
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,980

00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,020
-You okay? -Yeah.

-今天很糟, 是吧？ -是啊 

142
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:32,460
It's just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean, he's a doctor.
看到他那个样子很奇怪, 你知道吗？ 我是说, 他是个医生 

143
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,560
You don't expect doctors to get sick.
医生怎么会得病的呢？

144
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,700
But we do.
但我们确实会得病 

145
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,700
He's gonna be okay, Rach.
你知道, 他会好的, 瑞秋

146

I don't want him to wake up alone. I should go to the hospital.

-什么, 不, 等等 嘿, 你看, -什么

148
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,180
They gave him a lot of medication.
他服了很多镇静药

149
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,180
He wouldn't even know if you were there.

150
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,650
We'll go see him first thing in the morning.
我们明天一早就去看他, 好吗？

151
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,190
-Really? I shouldn't feel guilty? -No.. God, hey.
-真的, 我不去也没事儿？ -没事儿, 上帝 嘿

152
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,590
Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, okay?
瑞秋, 你是个好女儿, 知道吗？

Would you stay here with me for a little while?

-Sure. -Okay.

Me too. Come here.

161
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,810
I just don't wanna be alone tonight.

162
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:43,130
Okay, well, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag or..
好吧, 唔, 我可以找条睡袋什么的…

163
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,440
No, Rach!
不行, 瑞秋！

164
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,880
I'm sorry, I just don't think this is a good idea.
抱歉, 我只是觉得这样不好 

165
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,080
Well, we won't know that until we do it, will we?
我们不做怎么知道好不好, 对吧？

166
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,980
Look..
不, 呃, 你看, 嗯…

167
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,850
You are upset about your father, and you're feeling vulnerable..
你为你父亲的事儿心烦, 你现在很脆弱 

168
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,050
and I just don't feel it would be right.
而且我觉得这样不太好

169
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,930
I feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.
我觉得这时候占你的便宜不太合适 

170
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,300
What..? Taking advantage? I am giving you the advantage. Enjoy!
什么? 占便宜? 我在主动投怀送抱, 你尽兴好啦！

171
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,770
Look, I'm sure it would be great..
是, 我肯定那会很棒, 但是…

172
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,240
but I think one of us has to be thinking clearly.
我认为我们俩得有一个保持清醒

173
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,880
So I'm gonna go.
所以我要走了 

174
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,750
Okay.

175
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,180
I'll see you in the morning.
明天早上见

I haven't had sex in four months. I should get a medal for that!
4个月没有性生活 我刚才的高姿态应该得块奖牌！

177
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,570
Thanks so much for taking me to all those places. I had a great time.
谢谢你们带我去了那么多地方 我玩得很高兴 

178
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,580

哦, 我也很高兴 但是, 我得为钱德道歉

-你怎么回事儿？ -你知道吗, 我以前去过那些地方

181
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,150
but I've never really seen them.
但是我都没有好好看过风景 

182
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,380
Yeah, you miss a lot when you're mooing.
没错, 你学牛叫的时候错过好多风景嘞 

183
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,660
Let's go to a Broadway show. Cats!
我们去看百老汇音乐剧<猫>吧

184
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,790
I think we've done enough.
我觉得我们做的够多了

185
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:30,270
Honey, these are actors dressed like cats who sing like people.
亲爱的, 他们装扮的像猫, 却又像人一样唱歌

186
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,670
I mean, come on!
我是说, 去

187

-Thank you for showing me around. -Oh, it was our pleasure.
-非常感谢你们带我观光  -哦, 我们很高兴陪你去

We're so much enjoying getting to know you.
我们也想跟你熟悉熟悉 

189

Well, if there's anything else you wanna know..

190
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,610
Okay.
哦, 呃, 好吧 

191
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,690
Can we ask you some questions about the father?
你不会介意我问几个有关孩子父亲的问题吧？

192
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,980
Oh, sure. Yeah.
哦, 没关系 

193
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,650
Well, he was my high-school boyfriend, captain of the football team, really cute.
呃, 他是我高中的男朋友 足球队长, 很可爱 

194
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,770
-Got a scholarship and went to college. -That's great.
-后来他得到奖学金, 上了大学  -那不错啊 

195
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,370
Yeah, it's almost definitely him.
是啊, 差不多就是他了 

196
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,510
How's that, now?
那怎么说？

197
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,770
Well, there's a chance it's another guy.
唔, 也有可能是另外一个人 

198
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:15,470
I mean, I've only ever been with two guys..
我是说, 我只跟两个人好过

199
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:18,050
but they sort of overlapped.
但是时间上有些重叠 

200
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,340
So, what does the other guy do?
那么, 另一个人是干什么的

201
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,960
-Does he go to college too? -No, he's in prison.
-他也上大学了吗？ -不, 他在蹲监狱 

202
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,850
Was he falsely accused of something?
呃, 那他是被诬告的吧？

203
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,030
No.
不 

204
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,460
He killed his father with a shovel.
他用铁铲杀了他爸爸 

205
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,330
Other than that, he's a great guy.
但是除此之外他还是个不错的人 

206
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,610
I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
我猜他爸爸不这么想 

207
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,440
-Are you awake? -Of course I'm awake.
-你还没睡？ -我当然还没睡 

208
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,590
Assume from now on that I'm always awake.
从今往后我是睡不着啦 

209
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:58,790
All right, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy.
好啦, 我们也不知道就一定是他  我是说, 也可能是那个踢足球的 

210
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,620
Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel killer.
亲爱的, 我们这对儿倒霉蛋 肯定是摊上那个铁铲杀手 

211
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,690
Well, all right, let's say that it is him.
好了, 好了, 就算是他 

212
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,560
Would we not want the baby? No.
我们就不要这孩子了？不

213
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,110
-Would we treat him any differently? -I'd keep an eye on him.
-我们会对他另眼相待吗？ -我会一直提防着他的！

214
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,770
We have to find out who the father is.
我们一定得查出哪一个是孩子的父亲 

215
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,740
-How? -I don't know.
-怎么查？ -我不知道

216
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,050
-They have tests for these things, right? -Yes, but maybe we're just overreacting.
-这种事儿可以测出来的, 对吧？ -是, 不过我们也许反应过度了 

217
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,590
Easy for you to say. He's a father killer.
你说得当然轻巧, 他杀的是他爸爸 

218
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,990
He probably loves his mommy.
他没准儿很爱他老妈 

219
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,720
He's probably got a tattoo that says "Mom" on his shovel-wielding arm.
他没准儿在挥铲子的胳膊上刺着 "妈妈" 呢 

220
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,800
We'll now count from one to five.
现在我们从一数到五: . . . . .

221
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,010
-Good job. -Thank you.

-Hey. -Hey, Joey.

听我说, 昨天的事儿我觉得不太好

224
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,720
No, I was too impatient. So let's try it again.
我想是我太没有耐心了  所以, 我们今天再试试 

225
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,690
That's okay. I don't need your help.
不, 不用了 我不用你帮忙了 

226
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,760
I worked on it myself, and I gotta say I am pretty good.
我可以自学而且我得说我学的还不错嘞 

227
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:16,470
-Really, can I hear some of it? -Sure, sure.
-真的？说几句给我听听  -当然可以 

228
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,900

You, you're not..

You're not.. You're..

232
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:36,320
Again, you're not speaking French!
我再次重申, 你说的不是法语！

233
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,060
Oh, well, I think I am. Yeah, and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.
哦, 我觉着我说的是法语 而且我肯定能得到那个角色 

234
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,290
How could you possibly think that?
你怎么会这么想的？

235
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,160
The guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!
至少, 磁带上的那家伙说我念得不错！

236
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,100
Hey, Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?

In the future..
以后

244
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:23,600
when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex, just do it.
如果有女孩子需要点不理智的、 安慰性的性生活, 你就满足她好啦 

245
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,700
Wait, wait, you're mad at me about last night?
等等, 你是因为昨晚的事儿生我的气？

If you had done the right thing..
唔, 对我来说要是你做得对的话
