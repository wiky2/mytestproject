What do you think, Phoebe?
你怎么看, 菲比？

53
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,680
Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin-Robbins.
我觉得你穿这件衬衣 像雪糕餐厅的服务员 

54
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,510

We cannot tell Joey about this.

He's already flipping out about everything changing.

64
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,550
This'll push him over the edge.
不能再刺激他了 

65
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,350
-You don't think we should tell him? -Not for a while.
-你真的认为我们不应该告诉他吗？ -至少暂时不说

Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.
除非是八卦的史努比告诉查理布朗 否则就没问题 

69
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,740
-May I help you? -Yeah. I'm a friend of Rachel Green's.
-有什么事吗？ -我是瑞秋格林的朋友

then we'll see if she wants to come back.

She loved her job here. Let's face it, you're not gonna find anyone..
她很喜欢这份工作 实际上你找不到比她更好的人选

-She is good. -I took a shot there.
-她是很不错  -我真没料到

可是, 很抱歉 我无能为力 

82
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,050
Oh, that's not true. There's nothing I want to do.
事实是, 我不想出力 

83
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,720

是的, 他老是说起 那又怎么样？

我说的, 你都听到了  不是那么回事

让我再说一遍  我是古生物学家

-你真的可以安排到吗？ -如果你能让瑞秋回来, 那就这么定了

我想, 让瑞秋回来, 不见得就是坏事

有一部电视电影 其中的角色很合适我演...

106
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:45,080
and I didn't even get put up for it. She better have a good reason.
她没有推荐我去 她必须告诉我原因 

107
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,860
I'm guessing she does.

108
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,760
Well, I wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this.

答应我, 等一会再打给她 

111
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,370
Well, okay. Why?
为什么？

112
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:07,410
Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.

113
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,050

115
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,700
I was just gonna call you. That's weird.
我正想打电话给你 真古怪 

116
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,600
It's a little coincidental, but believable.
这是巧合, 但是可信 

117
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:37,540
Listen, I'm sure you're wondering why I didn't get you..

I guess I dropped the ball there.
我想我失职了 哦！

121

就这样？我最近老是失职

不要这么和我说话 你以为自己是谁？

123

I feel like we're cheating on our house.
我感到这是对我们房子的不忠

Yeah, I just feel bad about firing Estelle.

This has gotta be killing her.

A coronary embolism might.

And yet I never run into Beyonce.

You two know each other?

Ellen, we're gonna talk numbers.

This cannot be happening.

珍妮丝可能就买不成了  另外的夫妇可能会买下

讨厌的"Oh.. my.. God!"

即使我们不买这座房子 她还是会在我们面前出现 

209
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,620
At least if she's here, it eliminates the element of surprise.
她住在这, 起码不会再吓我们一跳 

210

不过我有一个法子能让她会来 

218
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:13,300
This may surprise you, but rehiring fired employees is not my main job.
请你别见怪, 重新聘用已经解雇的员工 不是我主要的工作
