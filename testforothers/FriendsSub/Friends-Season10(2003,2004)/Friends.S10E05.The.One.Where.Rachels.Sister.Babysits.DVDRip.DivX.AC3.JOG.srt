Someone has a special question to ask.

I don't understand.

Some of the words a little too sophisticated for you?

141
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,670
It doesn't make any sense.
读不顺啊

On every word?
每个词都用？

144

All right, what was this sentence originally?

"They are warm, nice people with big hearts."

算了，你还是不要假装有学问 就用你的本色来写怎么样？

You don't need a thesaurus. Just write from here.
