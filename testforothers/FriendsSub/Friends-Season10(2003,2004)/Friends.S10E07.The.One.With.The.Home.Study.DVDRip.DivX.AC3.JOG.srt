Hey, you guys. Hey, what are you doing?
嗨，大家！在干什么?

00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,160
-Figuring out our wedding plans. -Funny. We were doing the same thing.
-筹备婚礼 -有趣得很, 我们也正合计这事呢

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,070
It's really crazy. The hall, the dress, the food.
疯了, 场地, 服装, 食品

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,840
-I had no idea how expensive this was. -Yeah, it is really pricey.
-没想到结个婚这么贵 -是很贵

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,350
-I freaked when I heard the numbers. -So, what did you two do about it?
-第一次算出结婚费用，我被那个数字吓呆了 -结果你们怎么做的?

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,680
It was simple. I came up with some cost-cutting solutions..
简单, 我各个项目都想出了一些省钱的方案

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,450
wrote out a list, and Monica told me to go to hell.
结果莫妮卡叫我去死

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,320
There's no way around it. Just accept that this is gonna cost a lot of money.
没钱好省的, 接受事实, 这的确所费不赀

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,960
I heard that weddings are, like, a $40 billion-a-year industry.
听说每年花在结婚上的钱高达400亿

10
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:43,330
Yeah. And I'm responsible for just, like, half of that.
这其中我贡献过半

11
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,160
I don't know. It's a lot of money to spend on one day.
我不知道, 一天花这么多钱

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,180
Hey, I've been married before, I don't need a big wedding.
嘿, 我以前结过婚 我都没有盛大的婚礼

13
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,610
All I ask is that you don't do ecstasy and make out with my brother.
我所想知道的是你没有迷上我弟弟并和他上床

14
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,880
But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use.
我觉得这钱应该用在更有意义的事上

15
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,520
Hey, you could buy a ton of Amway products.
嘿, 你可以买一吨安利的产品

16
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,660

-或者全部捐给慈善机构 -喔, 这个想法不错

17
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,030
How am I gonna unload all those Amway products?
那些安利的东西该怎么样卸货呢?

18
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,260
Are you serious?
当真?

19
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,000
Yeah. How would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity..
把婚礼经费捐献给慈善事业

20
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,300
and we just got married at City Hall?
我们就到市政厅登个记？

21
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,770
I think it would make me wanna marry you even more.
这让我越发想娶你了!

22
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,810
I gotta say, you guys, that's an incredible gesture.
高姿态! 很好

23
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,970
Maybe you do that next time you get married.
下次你结婚也这么干如何?

24
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:36,320
No, no, no. The next time's gonna be Hawaii at sunset.
下次我要在夏威夷斜阳下结婚

25
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,220
But maybe the time after that.

00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,020
The One With The Home Study

00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,020
rainystar压制iPod-MP4

26
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,200
-Hey. What's going on? -Hey.
-嘿！ 忙啥呢？ -嘿！

27
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,010
Our adoption social worker is coming, so we're cleaning the apartment.
领养中心有人来家访，所以我们在扫除

28
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,050
"We"?
我们？

29
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,490
You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways.
你不想我掺和，拖你后腿！

30
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,290
Is this the person who decides whether or not you get a baby?
这个人说了算？

31
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,660
-She's coming to see where we live. -And it has to go perfectly.
－差不多，这人来视察我们的生活环境 －我们必须表现得完美

32
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,670
If she doesn't like us, she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.
若她有丝毫不满，我们就永远没戏

33
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,430
Hey, maybe I should stop by. She could be a soap opera fan.
我可以过来友情协力一把 她没准爱看肥皂剧

34
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,600
It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.
小人物认识演艺名流，可以蓬壁生辉呢

35

"Celebrity."
名流

37
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,280
So I think I'm just about done here.
差不多满分了

38
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:13,220
Unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like porn or cigarettes?
除非你还有什么，像色情书刊，香烟？

39
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,150

-No. -Chandler.
－才没有！ －钱德

41
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,360
I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation.
你无中生有，污人清白

42
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,130
So there's not a magazine under the couch..

or a filthy video in the VCR?
录像机里没有A片?

45
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,640
I'll admit to the cigarettes and magazine. But that tape is not mine.
香烟和杂志我认帐，但录像带
不是我的！

46
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,870
-It isn't mine. -I guess we'll never know whose it is.
-也不是我的！ -永远不会知道是谁的了！

47
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,680
May I help you?
可以帮忙吗？

48
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,450
Yes. We're here to make a rather sizable donation to the children.

数目这样大，你一定会异常感激

Well, on behalf of the children, thank you both very much.

Actually, that's the shirt I wore to the gym.

63
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,540
It's moist.

Oh, my God. What?

Like I said, I was thinking of taking Emma to the Museum of Knives and Fire.
我又没说带她去武器弹药博物馆

All right, if you must know, I had a traumatic..

swing incident when I was little.

And I was on the swing..

and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain.
突然头发缠到铁链

80
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:00,290
And to get me out, my mom had to cut a big chunk of my hair.

And it was uneven for weeks.
结果有好几星期头发都不整齐

And you made it through that?

I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie.

Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy.

-我们同去, 你就知道了 -秋千速度40英里/小时

when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to Earth.

你不会像有的妈妈那样 把自己愚昧的恐惧遗传给小孩吧

96
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,920
"Irrational, " huh?
愚昧?

97
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,790
I'll remember that next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment.
下次你被家里的蜘蛛吓到 我们再谈这个话题

98
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,230

这两个可以相提并论吗! 秋千上有30种毒液?

不过我不需要头纱, 我根本不需要服装

抱歉, 只是无法想象. 一生只有一次啊

我们不一样! 我不在乎什么盛大婚礼

116
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,460
This is really nice for you, but..

市政厅的人该忙不过来了

This is her wedding day. That's way more important than some stupid kids.
她结婚!这可比什么 愚蠢的小孩子重要多了!

That's sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption lady.
说得好, 省着点, 等领养中心的人来了 再表演不好吗

关我啥事 这也许是好事

We've really been spoiling the children, what with all the food and warm clothing.
别把孩子惯坏了 让他们吃饱穿暖怎么行

So I deserve a real celebration.

你个流汗男, 别想让我内疚!

我们爱小孩, 爱得要死

181

We love kids the appropriate amount..

Yes, this building does have a wholesome, family feel to it.
这栋楼有很多家住户

我好象来过, 这里还有谁申请领养?

罗斯，看, 早告诉你了, 秋千危险

算了, 这辈子再也不许艾玛接近它

00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,450
You are welcome to look under any of the furniture..
你尽可以在各种家具下面搜查

252
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:45,110
because, believe me, you won't find any porn or cigarettes under there.
绝无色情书刊和香烟什么的!

253
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,690
Before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need up to here.
在到处看看之前, 要问你们一些问题

254
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,000
Why don't I show you the baby's room.
带你看看婴儿房

255

-What are you doing? -You wouldn't let me in.
-你干啥? -你不让我进来

But you called me "Bert."
但你叫我"bert", 

258
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,480
That's our code word for danger.
那是"危险"的暗号

259
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:18,580
-We don't have a code word. -We don't?
-我们没约定过什么暗号 -是吗？ 

260

We really should.

262
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,360
So that was the baby's room.
参观完婴儿房

263
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,470
-What room should we see next? -Any room that isn't behind this couch.
-下面参观哪里？ -除了沙发下面都可以参观！

00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:48,820
I did not care for that.

You have to leave.

你连我名字也忘了，我叫乔伊
