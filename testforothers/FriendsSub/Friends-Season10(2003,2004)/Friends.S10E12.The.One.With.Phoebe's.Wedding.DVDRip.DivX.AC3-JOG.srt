哦, 莫妮卡让我把她送到我妈那里去了 

67
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,300
Apparently, babies and weddings don't mix.
显然, 婴儿和婚礼可掺合不到一块儿 

68
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,410
Are you still crying about your damn baby?
你还在为你那烦人的小家伙哭哭啼啼的?

菲比, 待会儿（在致酒时）你要说快点  记住, 跟每个人都是20秒

-嘿, 你们是麦克的父母吧? -是的

Our little ones are growing up fast, aren't they?
眼看着我们的小家伙们都长这么大了, 是吧？

75
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,540
-How's that? -You know..
-你说什么? -你知道   

76

on one hand, you're happy for them. On the other, it's hard to let go.
我们做父母的, 一方面替他们感到高兴 但另一方面, 心里又难免有点舍不得

How do you want to divide up the holidays?

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,540
Who in God's name are you?

80
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,310
I'm not that fond of you either, buddy. I'm just trying to be nice for the kids.
嘿, 我也不喜欢你们, 知道吗? 我是看在孩子们的面子上才跟你们客气的 

81
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,230
You know what? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
你知道我刚想起什么吗? 咱俩还没有被分配在婚礼上的任务呢

82
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,330

对啊,我觉得咱们会是伴郎 但都到这会儿了, 他们怎么还不跟咱俩说呢?

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,230
If it helps, you were next in line. You just missed the cut.
如果这么说能让你们好受一点, 你们两个是头号候补, 就差那么一点

95
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,770
Oh, man.
哦, 天哪.

96
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,210
This is like figure skating team all over again.

I mean, synchronized swimming.

-Please. You're going down. -You are going "downer."
-省省吧, 你逊死了  -你更逊.

125
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,280
They say that on the figure skating team?
他们在选花样滑冰队员的时候 就是这么说你的？

126
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,180
I wouldn't know. I didn't make it.
我不知道, 我没被选上

127
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,190
You know I'm filling in for Phoebe's stepdad tomorrow, right?
明天我会扮演菲比的继父, 你知道吧?

-我“企图”跟她结婚  -哦, 你这一拳打得还挺聪明

I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano?
照我的理解, 你似乎打算靠弹钢琴来养活老婆

132
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,930
Isn't that kind of unstable?
这种工作好像不太稳定 

133
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:40,040
-No more so than acting. -Strike two.
-哦, 跟演戏比起来还算好啦  -第二拳 

134
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,620
You're right. She probably will support me.

135
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,880
Hey, unless we move in with you, Dad.
嘿, 除非我们搬去跟你一起住, 爸爸

137
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,690
You only get one more, Mike.
你只有最后一次机会了, 麦克 

138

-Michael, can I see you for a moment? -Yeah, sure.
-麦克, 我能和你聊聊吗? -当然可以

139
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,860
This was..
那真是..

140
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,530
weird.
太怪了

141
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,000
-Hi. -Hey.
-嗨 -嘿

142
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,440
What's with the face?
脸怎么了?

143
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,980
That Mike has got no respect. I'm not sure about him.
那个麦克不尊重人. 我不知道他人怎么样

144
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,150
Wait, that's not him. There he is.

I decided to pee.

147
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,330
You have to choose one of us to be in your wedding.
你要在我们两个人里选一个来参加仪式 

148
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,900

-有个伴郎来不了了 -哦, 不

I can't choose between you two. I love you both so much.
你们两个叫我怎么选啊  你们对我来说同样重要 

150
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:37,500
Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
的确重要, 差一点就能参加原定的婚礼了 

151
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,940
Such bitterness.
真痛苦

152
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,600
Best to keep that attitude in the seats.
最好把这态度留到婚礼

153
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,940
Come on, Phoebe. We both really want to do this, and it's up to you.
来吧, 菲比. 我们都想参加, 而且由你来决定

But I don't wanna choose. It's..
我没法选 这太...

155
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,880
Okay, wait. Rach?
哦, 等一下 瑞秋！

156
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,850
Listen, I have a very special bridesmaid task for you to do.

Goody! What is it?
太棒了! 选什么?

158
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,630
Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman..
嗯, 现在伴郎有一个空缺

159
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,560

什么, 什么? 不, 不要, 我不想选这个 

161
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,340
I guess I have to find a new bridesmaid.
好吧, 我想我只好去另找一个新的伴娘了

I'll do it!

-到你敬酒的时间了  -我能不能先去一下洗手间?

You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike.
你去洗手间的时间是20:30  要专时专用, 麦克.

166
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,120

关于致酒词, 要尽量简短一些 

167
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,280
Nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay.
婚礼彩排的时候 没有什么比又臭又长的致酒词更烦人了 

168
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,790
You just get in, do your thing, and get out.
你要做的就是：上场, 干活, 然后走人 

169
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,790
Is that what you say to Chandler?
你跟钱德也这么说?

170
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,190
It's 2101, and I am not amused.
现在已经21:01了, 而且我一点也不觉得好笑 

171
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,330

大家可能还不知道, 我和麦克的开始一点也不精彩 

176
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,520
Yeah. My friend Joey and I..

马莉兰今晚没有来, 因为她...

181
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:22,040
It's not important. Well, she's in rehab.
这不重要, 她...

182
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:27,380
Anyway. So Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike..
总之, 乔伊说他要介绍他的朋友麦克给我认识

183
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:31,180
only he didn't have a friend Mike, so he just brought my Mike.
但他并不认识什么叫麦克的朋友 所以他就把我的麦克, 呃, 带去了

184
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,620

I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here.
好, 我想要在这里用一点点时间 来缅怀一下我的母亲  她今晚不能出席,因为...

187
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,430
Oh, God.

188
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,860
And.. And moment's over.

189
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:50,000
So okay.. Oh, no, forget that.
好了, 呃... 哦, 这个就不说了, 然后...

190
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,260
I can forget that. Oh, this is funny.
我可以跳过这里哦, 这个很有意思

191

We're gonna have hair and makeup in the bathroom.
我们要在卫生间里面做头发, 然后...

206
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,720
I had to move a couple things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.
哦, 我要把冰箱里的东西挪一下 给襟花腾出地方 

207
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,630

as someone who's never been fired before..

What about in high school..

214
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,320
when that yogurt store let you go for sampling toppings?
当卖乳酸的小店让你做样品招牌?

215
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,920
Everyone there did that.
大伙都这么做

216
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,620
Yeah, but did everybody owe 3 grand at the end of the summer?
对啊! 但是不是每个人 都在暑假结束时赚了3000块?

我还是不太想给你这个耳机 

225

还有就是, 如果你要接手的话 你大概需要回复这些信息 

226
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,620
This is a lot.
哇, 真不少啊

I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation.
我要跟她谈谈关于那个伴郎的问题

233
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:19,350
I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm in the seats like some chump.
我可不想像个傻子一样坐在那儿 看着钱德在婚礼上露脸 

234
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,150
This wedding isn't about you.

It's not? Then who's it about?

00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,740
You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?
你还没决定伴郎的人选吧?

240
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,540
Ross, please don't make this harder than it already is.
哦, 罗斯, 求你了 我已经很为难了, 你就别再添乱了 

241
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:49,770
I'm not. I'm making it easier. Pick me.
我没有啊  我是在让事情简单化, 选我!

246
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:06,060
If I said yes that would freak you out, wouldn't it?
如果我说是, 就会让你发疯, 是不是?

247
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,130
Listen. Listen.

Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you.

I was always picked last in gym..
在运动场上我永远都是被人家挑剩下的那个

就算是那个交换学生, 那个连什么是棒球 也不知道的傻大个儿也排在我前面 

310
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,890
I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third.
那个家伙一打着球, 撂下球棒就朝三垒上跑

It's just so humiliating.
真是太耻辱了

总之, 如果我成为唯一一个不能参加婚礼的人
