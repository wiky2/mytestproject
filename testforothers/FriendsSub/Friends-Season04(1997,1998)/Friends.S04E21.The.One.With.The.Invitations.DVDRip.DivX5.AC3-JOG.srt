...only by the ass print on this chair!

We have to do something. Something huge!

I saw an ad for this video.

People climb that thing every day. We could totally do that!

-It's just steep! -Yeah.

-We're gonna climb Mt. Everest. -Yeah,baby!
我们要去爬珠峰 没错

20
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,550
I looked into that.
真的？我也去问过

21
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:09,290
Yeah,but it costs like $60,000, and,you know,you could die.
但是要花6万，而且可能会死

We could get that Everest video.
我们可以去借珠峰的录影带

24
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,570
We could do that without risking our lives at all.
对，那样就不必冒生命危险

25
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,570
While we're at the video store, we could rent Die Hard!
到了录影带店 我们还可以借“终极警探”

26
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,510
I just remembered.
