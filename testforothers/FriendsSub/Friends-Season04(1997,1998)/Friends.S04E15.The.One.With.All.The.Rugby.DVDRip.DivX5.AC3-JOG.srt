What's going on?

钱德，快来 我教你怎么把内衣裤塞进鞋子

It's a space-saver.

拜托 你连跟我爸打羽毛球都会受伤

00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,990
That's because your mom's dog kept looking at me.
那是因为你妈的狗一直看我

You should've seen the guy she used to date.

He's like "Joe Rugby"!
他活像颗大橄榄球

167
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,350
You're kidding! And he plays rugby? That's funny!
不会吧，而他又打橄榄球？ 好好玩

Don't worry about me.

好，如果你一定要打 至少让我帮忙

不行，这不是女人玩的 那些人什么都捉
