That means that it's,like, 75% chance of no baby at all?
这表示我生不出小孩的机率 是75%？

The thing is,we kind of only have one shot.

天啊，这让我和我的子宫 压力超大

Wow,you guys really don't know anything.

那她喝个烂醉如何？ 我很多高中同学 都是这样搞大肚子的

I know,I know.

124
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,890
It's such a huge, life-altering thing.
