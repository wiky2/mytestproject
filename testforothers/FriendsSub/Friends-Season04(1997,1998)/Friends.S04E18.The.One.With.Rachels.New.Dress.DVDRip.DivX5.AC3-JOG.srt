...Chan-no-ey?

139

Joey? Think about it. He'll never be President.

There will never be a President Joey.

141
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,980
I didn't want to bring this up.
听着，我本来不想提的

142
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:31,290
Chandler is the stupidest name I've heard in my life!
但钱德是我听过最蠢的名字

143
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,400
It's not a name! It's barely even a word.
它根本不是名字 连个词都不是

144
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,590
It's like chandelier but it's not!
它有点接近钱包，但又不是

145
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,460
Then,you put it together with Bing and forget about it.
再配上“宾”就更别提了

146
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,370
It's a stupid,stupid,non-name!
它是个蠢到爆的非名字

148
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,620
You're right. I have a horrible,horrible name.
天哪 你说得对，我的名字烂透了

I'm sorry,man. I'm sorry.
对不起，我不是…对不起

150

So I guess it's Joey then.

This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.

Behind you.

159
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:44,630
They used to live here, and sometimes they migrate back over.
没事，它们以前住这里 有时会迁徙回来

160
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,540
Is there some way that they could not be here?
能不能让它们不要在这里 

161
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,610
Farm birds really kind of freak me out!
我最怕家禽了

162
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:56,584
好

163
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,240

So,farm birds,huh?

00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,310
It's my only weird thing,I swear.
我只有这个怪癖，我发誓

169
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:30,410
I would have told you. I didn't know that they'd be here.
我不知道会有鸡鸭 否则我会告诉你

170
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,590

It'll take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
它们得啄很久才能把墙啄穿

176

That's not funny.
一点也不好笑

177
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,120
Would you feel better if we went someplace else?
那要不要换个地方？ 

178
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,220
We could pack this stuff up and go to your apartment.

179
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,480
They're working on it. It's a mess.
我家正在装修，一团混乱

They're out of town.

Any word from Susan?

You wore your nightie to dinner?

最精彩的是 我背后被服务生泼到水时

I jumped up and my boob popped out.

Am I a Mark or a John?

You're not tall enough to be a Mark.

320

But you might make a good Barney.

This name has held me back my entire life.
这个名字拖累了我一辈子

325

It's why kids picked on me and why I never do well with women.
害我被其他小朋友找碴 女人运很差

明天4点起我不是马克约翰森 就是约翰马克森

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
