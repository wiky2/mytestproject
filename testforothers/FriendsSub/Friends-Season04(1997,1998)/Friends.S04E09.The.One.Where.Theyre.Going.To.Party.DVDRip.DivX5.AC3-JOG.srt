“档案管理系统”？ 你说资料夹上黏的彩色标签啊

It did brighten up the filing cabinets.

I love working with designers.

One for me,and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head."
一份给自己 一份给拿枪抵着我的人

123
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,240
You really laid into this place.
你真把这家店批得一文不值

124
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,440
They don't pay me a penny a word to make friends.
报社付我钱 可不是要我广结善缘

125
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,020
I found a guy who'd fix up the van for catering.
我得走了，我找到一个人 他能搞定那部外烩厢型车

You want me to go?
要我一起去吗？

127
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:16,620
It's okay. Are we sure we don't want the waterbed?
不用了，没关系 但你确定我们不要那张水床？

128
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:23,530
Because it would be silly to take it out if we're just gonna put it back in again.
如果拿下来又要放回去 那不是很蠢吗？

129
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,490
Haven't we made this decision?
我们不是早就说好了？

130
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,030
Yeah,all right.

274
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,930
Actually,could I get some hot water with lemon?
我能来杯热水加点莱姆汁吗？

275
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:50,830
I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
我刚才在那家店里都喊到哑了 他们音乐非要开那么大声吗？

276
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,070
I can't hear a word. My ears are ringing so bad.
我听不到你说什么 我耳鸣得厉害

277
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,780
I was glad I had that extra pair of socks.
幸好我多带了一双袜子

278
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,340
I used them as mittens.
拿来当手套用

279
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:02,540
I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.
最后那家店脏到我不敢用手碰

280
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,420
How sad are we?

00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,360
You know what? We're not sad.

283

We're just not 21 anymore. You know?

I'm 29 years old,damn it!

285
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,190
I want to sit in a comfortable chair,watch TV...

286
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,200
...and go to sleep at a reasonable hour.
时间到了就上床睡觉

287
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,570
I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
我喜欢去安静一点的地方 才能好好跟朋友聊天

288
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,610
And so what if I like to go home, put on Kenny G and take a bath?
就算回家听肯尼吉的音乐洗澡 又有什么大不了？

289
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,080
We're 29. We're not women.

Okay,I'm hearing.

293
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,200
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
我想了很多

294
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,470
I came up with a bunch of businesses that you can do with your van.
我想出了你用厢型车 可以做的所有生意

295
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,480
You could be a flower delivery person.

I got a whole bunch of stuff in this area.

-No. -Okay.

303
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,590
I guess if you don't want to deliver...
我猜若你不想送货的话…

304
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,670
...you probably don't want to pick up stuff either.
八成也不会想去载货

305

00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,810

-Heard what? -Joanna...

-...it happened? -No,nothing.
..交给你？ 完全没有

342

Imagine,if she'd just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.
只盼当初 她晚个几秒钟过街就没事了

344
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,200

I'm sorry. I have to go.

虽然开除艾米里欧主厨 让我觉得很过意不去

352

It is like losing a member of the family.
那就像是失去了一个家人

353
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:20,730
Of course,that literally is the case for several of you.

Tony,Carlos,Marie...

请向令尊转达 我们会有多想念艾米里欧

358
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,620
So without much further ado...

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
