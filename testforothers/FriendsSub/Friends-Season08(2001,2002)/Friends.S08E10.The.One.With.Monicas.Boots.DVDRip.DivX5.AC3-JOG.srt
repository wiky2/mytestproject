Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?
菲比阿姨，你来这里做什么？

我听说 你跟一个同学处不好

我想来帮你们冷静下来 好好地谈一谈，解决所有问题

杰克？我恨他，他是个混蛋

你朋友道格 长得好像比利乔

-他是他的爸爸吗？ -不，他爸爸是牙医

00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:25,970
It was difficult coming out to my parents.
我爸妈 很难接受这种事

161
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:30,170
Well, hi. I'm Jenny Boon. I'm a new teacher here.
嗨，我是珍妮布恩 我是新来的老师

对，你要找杰克父母 讨论他跟班的问题吗？

That sounds good.

我能影印一份吗？ 卡萝把它丢了，她弄丢了我们的联络簿

她真的很糊涂 但天啊，她的屁股真的很好看

-我看不到计程车，或许我们该走路 -不，我们不能走路

No. Hey, there's a cab.

175
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,440
That's a police car.
那是警车

176
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,510
Maybe we could commit a crime, have them pick us up.
或许我们该犯个法 让他们来逮捕我们

177
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,950
-It's 15 blocks to the subway. Come on. -Okay.
-离地铁站只有15条街远，来吧 -好吧

178
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:45,380
Do you think we can get to the subway if we climb through that manhole?
你想我们可以从那个下水道孔 直接掉到地铁站里吗？

-它们真的很紧吗？ -我只是说你说的对，甜心

你看不出来我痛到快发疯了吗？

It's oddly unsettling.

How are we gonna we get home? Maybe a piggyback ride?
我们要怎么回家？ 我们来玩骑马打仗吧

-Hop on. -Okay, wait.

Let me just get my boots off first.

Oh, God.
天啊

我知道你很痛 但我有点心痒痒的

00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:36,260
As beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, this is not legal.
虽然这个婚礼既漂亮又温馨 这是不合法的

205
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:42,870
They don't have a marriage license or witnesses, and the groom only has one shoe.
他们没有结婚证书或证婚人 而且新郎只穿一只鞋

206
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,130
Yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.

What am I supposed to do?
我该怎么办？

208
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:52,800
You're supposed to realize they are adults and that can make their own decisions.
你应该了解他们是成年人 可以自己做决定

209
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:57,450
No, they can't. They were stupid enough to get knocked up!
不，他们不能 他们笨到让自己怀孕

210
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,380
Contraceptives are not always effective. Right?
预防措施不一定有效 对吧？

211
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:09,330
-Yeah. We kind of didn't use any. -Come on, kids, a little help here!
-对，我们没有做预防措施 -孩子们，帮帮我吧

212
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,090
Wow! This place is incredible!
这个地方真的很棒

213
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,640
Sting's pen..
史汀的笔…

214
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,970
that he gave to Phoebe.
他送给了菲比

215
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,310
Come on, secret passageway.
来吧，秘密通道

216
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,250
-Hi. -Hi.
-嗨 -嗨

217
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,360
I'm Trudie. You must be Ben's mum.
我是楚蒂，你一定是班的妈妈

218
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,860
-Why else would I be here? -Why don't you sit down.
-不然我为什么要到这里来呢？ -请坐

219
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,590
I gather Jack and Ben haven't been getting along lately.
我知道杰克跟班 最近处得不太好

220
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,860
I'm sure there are two sides to this story.
我相信这个故事一定有两面说法

221
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,730
But all I've heard is that Ben's a bit of a "poo-poo-head."
但我听到的是 班是个“大笨蛋”

222
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,280
-I'm sorry, won't Jack's father be joining us? -No.
-抱歉，杰克的爸爸不会来吗？ -不会

223
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:04,220
I see. You see, I think it would be better for the children..
我懂了，我觉得 如果父母都能来…

224
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:10,120
if all the parents were here. Except for, you know, Ben's birth mother and father.
对孩子们比较好 但班的生母跟爸爸除外

225
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,750
Well, I'm sorry. Jack's father's not available.
对不起 杰克的爸爸没空

226
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,990
Okay. Well, then, could we reschedule for Friday night, perhaps at 8:00?
好吧，我们可以再约 星期五晚上八点见吗？

227
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,790
No, I know that wouldn't work. My husband's in concert.
不，我想那是行不通的 我丈夫要办演唱会

228
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,870
Concert. Yeah. That does put us in quite a pickle.
演唱会，对 那让问题变得有点棘手

229
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:32,910
I'm busy before and after the concert, and he's obviously busy during.
演唱会前后我都有事 演唱会的时间他又很忙

230
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:37,140
So I guess you and I should talk about Jack and Ben right now.
我想你跟我 现在该来谈谈杰克跟班的事

231
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,840
Unless.. Unless..
除非…

232
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:44,010
Okay, I would be willing to go to the concert..
我愿意到演唱会上…

233
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,320
all the while thinking about the children.
想一想孩子们的事

234
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:52,120
-Are you here for tickets? -Thank you. Four would be great.
-你是来要票的吗？ -谢谢，四张就够了

235
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:57,670
I'm not giving concert tickets to someone who'd use their son like this.
我不会把演唱会门票 送给这样利用自己孩子的人

236
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:01,170
Then you're in luck. Ben's not my son.
那正好，班不是我的儿子

237
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,440
Look, I've just pressed a button triggering a silent alarm.
听着，我已经按下 静声警铃

238
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:09,080
