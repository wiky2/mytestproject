00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,610
When my sisters were pregnant..

134
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,180
they got weird feelings and it was always nothing.

-Really? -Absolutely.
-真的吗？ -当然

136
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,760
But we'll stop by the hospital just to be sure. I'll page Ross.
但我们得到医院检查一下 我会呼叫罗斯

瑞秋，看着我，一切都会没事的 相信我，握着我的手，我们走吧

-Open it. -Why'd you..

-So? -She's fine.

She had Braxton Hicks contractions. Mild discomfort in the uterine wall.
她出现不规则的子宫收缩 那是子宫壁出现中度不适的现象

Contractions can be unnerving, but she's fine.

谢谢你，医生 谢谢你这么温和冷静

我一点都不冷静 我从来没有这么害怕过

-你说一切都会没事的 -我知道什么？我不是医生

-但一切都没事，我没事 -你确定？

152
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,190
Yes. I got half a mind to contract that doctor's uterus.
对，我真希望 那个医生的子宫也会收缩

153
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:42,490
Mild discomfort! What's he talking about?

-Is everything okay? -Yes.

Something called Braxton Hicks contraction.
她出现不规则的子宫收缩

157
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,130

那没什么大不了的 很多女人都不会有感觉

158
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,540
No uterus, no opinion.

159

What's with the candy?

I was at the concession stand at the movies.

So how's the inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?

但我觉得罗斯觉得自己被排除在外

我送瑞秋去医院时 医生以为我是孩子的爸

你应该看看罗斯的表情

你要怎么做？不送她去医院？ 你没有做错事

You make sex noises when you get massaged.
我按摩你时 你会发出性爱叫声

那把我吓坏了 之后我想弄痛你，你叫得更大声

I mean, hi.
我是说，嗨

207

所以亚丽珊卓帮我按摩时 都会戴耳塞

208
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,990
It's not because she hates Enya.

This is embarrassing. I'm never getting a massage again.
这真的是太丢脸了 我永远都不会再按摩了

00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:57,180
We'll try it again. Come back, and we'll work through it.
