-哪里不对劲吗？ -你知道什么是“不对劲”吗？

Everything isn't perfect or magical?

Everything isn't aglow with the light of fairies?

They were just brake lights, Parker!

Excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam.

You are like Santa Claus on Prozac.

At Disneyland, getting laid!

We could've gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar.
你坐在边车里 我们从婚礼现场走到接待处

261

It just isn't feasible.
那行不通

262
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:05,920
But a dove placing the ring on your finger would've been no problem.
但鸽子停在你的戒指上 就没有问题

263

-在天文馆求婚？ -我知道，那太蠢了

Are you kidding? With the lilies, and the song and the stars?
你在开玩笑吗？ 有百合花、歌跟星星？

267
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,950
It was really wonderful. Did you just make that up?

I thought of it when we were going out.

Well, that would've been very hard to say no to.
要拒绝你一定很难

It's a good thing I didn't do it, it sounds like a very expensive wedding.
还好我没有那么做 听起来那会是个昂贵的婚礼

-Okay, good night. -Good night.

274
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:15,920
Even if the sidecar had a windscreen to protect your hair?
即使边车有挡风玻璃 不弄乱你的头发？

275
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:19,460
-I will think about it. -That's all I'm asking.

That picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin.

I think she was.
