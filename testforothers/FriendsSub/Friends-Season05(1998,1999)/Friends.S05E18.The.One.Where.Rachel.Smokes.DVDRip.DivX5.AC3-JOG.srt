It's not for sure,but...

不过我们在公园里遇到一个人 他觉得班很可爱

Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition?
班去公园随便散个步 就有试镜自动送上门！

I mean, way to go, Ben!
我是说，班，真有你的

17
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,050
I've been in that park a million times and no one's offered me an audition.
那个公园我都去烂了 从来没人主动找我去试镜

18
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,820
It's crazy. We were pushing Ben on the swings
我知道，真的很神奇 我们只是在陪班玩荡秋千…

I'm always on the swings!

瑞秋，既然你在拉夫罗伦工作 能不能带几件马球衫回来？

If anybody gets free stuff, it's me.

I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.

But her birthday's not for another month.
可是一个月后才是她生日啊

35
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,950
If we throw her party on her birthday, it's not a surprise.
是没错，但在生日当天开派对 那就不惊喜啦

36
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,320
Great! We can have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
我觉得这主意不错 我们办个晚餐派对 邀请好朋友过来

So I gotta shut it down now?

I gotta go. I'm picking up Ben...

...and then we're off to the big audition.
...去参加大试镜

49

看到有演员假装是班的父亲 那种感觉一定很怪

Weirder than seeing his two moms make out?
是啊 怪过看班的两个妈妈温存？

Dad? There's a dad in the commercial?

Yeah. The dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
是啊，班和爸爸喝汤 演得很陶醉的样子

54
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:27,560
Maybe I'll go with you and audition as the dad.
或许我可以跟你们一起去 搞不好能试镜演那个爸爸

55
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,200
Who better to play Ben's father than his godfather?
说到扮演班的爸爸 由我这教父上场更最适合了

-You're not his godfather. -What?

00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,840
Of course I am.

They're gonna let me audition!

-That kid looks familiar. -Oh,yeah.
那个孩子看起来很眼熟 是啊

他拍过一堆广告 有糖果广告、新力PS游戏机

...and that one for the phone company.

71

Chandler was mad.
钱德因此还气得半死

72
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,990
He's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid.
不过他这次休想拿到这角色 因为班比他可爱多了

73
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,420
I mean, look at him.
看就知道，宝贝，看看你

That's great.

00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,500
Wouldn't it be great if I got to play Ben's dad?
不过若我能演班的爸爸 这样是不是很棒？

You look nothing like Ben.

I look more like him than you do.

So it's down to these two. Nancy,I know you like this one.
现在是最后的二选一 南茜，我知道你喜欢这一个

Then I take credit for them. I'm kidding!

She is kidding. But don't ever disagree with her again.

我不知道要选哪一个 不过先来根烟倒是真的

99
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:01,510
And then they came back from smoking and they'd made all of the decisions.
她们在抽烟的时候 就背着我做出了决定

100
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,280
-That's not fair. -I know.
这样不太公平 我知道啊！

It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisonous habit.
我不同流合污还被处罚！ 抽烟可是恶心又伤身的习惯

我只能在办公室里 呼吸愚蠢的新鲜空气

你们想她会选谁？ 是我还是乌烟瘴气的冒烟女？

We used to have a smoking area at work.
我们以前的公司有抽烟区

We used to put our cigarettes out in it.
把烟放进去捻熄就行了

瑞秋，你也可以一起去 不用抽烟，就说要去透透气

Or you could do the easy thing and smoke.

慢着，你在学乔伊那招吗？

146
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:30,670
"The audition didn't go so well.... Yeah,it did"?
“试镜不太顺利” 事实上很顺利！对吧？

148
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,430
Yeah,I am!
没错！

149
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,770
-Yeah,Ben got a second audition. -That's great!
班取得了第二次试镜的资格 太棒了

150
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:43,850
I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
我得教导罗斯我的戏份 因为我没有过关

151
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,920
You got a callback too, didn't you?
你也过关了，对吧？

152
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,850
Yeah,I did!
没错！

153
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,520
What are you doing out here?
瑞秋，你怎么会来这里？

154
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:03,030
It got kind of lonely up there, so I thought I would come out here...
里头有点无聊 我想说来这里...

155
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,270
...and get some fresh air.
...透透气

156
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,800
We're discussing the fall collection.
南茜和我正好讨论到秋装 

157
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,000
Oh,great.
太好了

158
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,270
Anyway,we really
所以这是要…

159
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,680
-Sorry. We're smoking all over you. -That's okay.
抱歉，瞧你被我们熏的 不好意思 没关系

160
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,510
We'll move. You stay there.
不成…你待着，我们走

162
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,440
I sent the designs to Ralph. He was excited about it.
反正我把设计寄给拉夫 他对衬里很中意

163
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,050
That's great! You are the best!
太好了，你是最棒的

164
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,380
Excuse me. Can I bum one of those?
不好意思，能给支烟吗？

165
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,990
Actually, this one's....
这支就好…

166
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,360
What's so funny over here?
你们在聊什么好笑的？

167
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,600
I thought you didn't smoke.
我还以为你不抽烟的

168
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,470
You know,I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes.
我以为你们是说大麻烟

169
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,640
You know what I mean? Doobies?
像是天使尘那种

170
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,840
Actually,I thought to myself, "Those guys are crazy!"
我还纳闷你们是疯了不成

171
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,570
But no,I smoke the regular ones all the time.
没啦，我自己也抽烟 照三餐天天都抽

172
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,680
We get high.
我们是在抽大麻

173
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,980
Me too.
我也是

174
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,690
I'm kidding.
闹你的

175
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,390
Me too.
我也是

176
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,660
Oh,God! This is so nerve-racking. How do you do this?
老天，这真是折磨人 你是怎么习惯的？

177
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,000
Fortunately,I don't get many callbacks, so....
我过关的经验不多，所以…

178
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,400
Is it a good sign that they asked us to wait?
我们在试镜之后被留下来 这是好现象吗？

179
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,230
Who knows?
天知道

180
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:24,180
We have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle...
最后入围的是雷蒙、班 凯尔...

181
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,680
...and Joey. The rest of you,thank you.
和乔伊 其余的人，辛苦了，谢谢

182
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,080
Yes! I knew it!

183
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,090
Bye-bye.
再会

184
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,120
So long.
别过

185
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,090
Later.
后会有期

186
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:42,200
I'm not married to him anymore. He's my ex-husband. I'm totally gay!
我不是他老婆喔，他是我前夫 我百分之百是女同志

187
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,740
This is great! I might get to play Ben's dad.
太棒了 我有可能饰演班的爸爸

188
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,400
Actually,that can't happen.
其实那是不可能的

189
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,670
Because you have such different looks...
因为你们各自的长相都不同

190
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,850
...we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben.
所以我们把你和雷蒙配对 凯尔和班是一组

191
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,710
So it'll either be you two or you two.
所以最后只有一组会出线

193
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,680
-This is gonna be kind of weird. -Yeah,it is.
要命，这样就有点尴尬了 真的是

194
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,690
Yeah. It's gonna be weird.
对，一定会很尴尬

195
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,290
No. We're like best friends. That's why it's weird.
因为我们是最好的朋友 所以才会尴尬

196
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,300
I thought we were just talking.
原来如此…我只是答腔而已

197
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:26,980
If Ben gets this commercial, do you think you can get me some free soup?
如果班拿到广告演出机会 你能帮我弄些免费的汤吗？

198
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,080
Chandler, a can of soup is like 60 cents.
钱德，一罐汤又不用多少钱

199
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,310
Yeah, okay,but I have been supporting a 29-year-old ltalian for five years.
对，但是我这五年来 都在供养这29岁的意大利人

200
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:40,380
Is it okay if I leave this here till Rachel's birthday party?
我能把这些东西放这里 等着给瑞秋过生日吗？

201
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,530
-Sure. What's in them? -Cups.
当然可以，里头是什么？ 杯子

203
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,730
Good, because we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
那好，因为我们替瑞秋 准备了八百加仑的水

204
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,870
That's a lot of cups.
老实说，这些杯子还真不少

205
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,400
I'm in charge of cups and ice.
对，这是因为我负责杯子和冰块

206
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:57,030
And Monica's gonna rue the day she put me in charge of cups and ice.
摩妮卡在这一天将后悔莫及 因为她要我负责杯子和冰块

207
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,650
You know,I rued the day once. Didn't get a whole lot else done.
我也后悔过一次 除了后悔没做别的

208
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,910
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.
好吧，该把其他杯子搬上来了

209
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:10,519

00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,560
Ross, I'm glad you're here.
罗斯，你在这里正好 

211
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,100
-I want to talk to you. -What's up?
我有事要跟你说 怎么了？

213
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:22,930
I've been thinking about this commercial thing. Me against Ben.
我一直在想这次拍广告的事 我和班硬碰硬

214
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:27,540
The two of us competing. That can't lead to anything good.
捉对厮杀 这样横竖都不会有好结果

216
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,570
I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'll tell them that I won't audition.
我想我还是退出好了 告诉他们我不去试镜

217
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,850
Joey, that's great. Thanks,man.
乔伊，太好了，多谢

218

That's it?
就这样？

You're gonna let me do this? It's my career we're talking about!
你真要让我这样做？ 这事关我的职业生涯耶

220
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,220
But you just
可是你说… 

221
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,030
I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it.
我是要套你说出让班退出

222
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,470
If anyone should step aside, it should be Ben.
罗斯，如果真有人要退出 那也应该是班

223
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,300
-What? -Chandler,tell him!

Why should Ben step aside?
班为什么应该退出？

227
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:17,220
It was his audition in the first place. You tagged along.

You're like the tagalong dad!

At least I care about his feelings.

230
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,390
What?
什么？

231
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,430
You know how hard it'll be on him when he doesn't get it?
你知道万一他没通过试镜 到时他会有多难过吗？

232
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,800
And why wouldn't he get it?
那他又为什么不会通过？

233
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,800
Come on!
得了吧？

Have you seen what my kid can do?

He plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!

237
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,950
Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
你是说你的小子喝汤 比我儿子厉害？

238
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,850
You just give him a spoon,baby.
你儿子才刚学会喝汤呢

239
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,450
Oh,yeah? I guess we'll see!
是吗？我们走着瞧

240
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,650
This commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
好啊，这支广告片的主角 非我和米契莫属

你的孩子叫做雷蒙 对，你的也是！

242
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,529
（中央咖啡馆）

-How did work go? -lt was great.

-Thanks. -No,I'm serious.
多谢 我是说真的

249
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,520
That's because I went down there and they were smoking.
因为那里的人全都在抽烟

250
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,180
This is actually the smell of success.

251
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,050
But there's something different

But it's so gross!

It's not that bad, you know?

I feel a little shaky and a little weird.
感觉怪怪的，还在发抖

264
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,830
But you gotta push past this, okay? Because it's about to get so good.
好，但你一定要撑过这一关 再来就会是快乐无比了

265
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,070
钱德

266
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,570
You smell so smoky, I gotta get up.

I think you smell great.

I'm so onboard.
我举双手双脚赞成

272
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,960

273
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,350
But you know what?

Tell me about it.

We'll just quit. Let's all quit!

282
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,840
-I never could do it. -But you could. Absolutely.

有碰不完的钉子 一点都不稳定

前一天你还是德瑞克医生

Is there a problem?

Damn it!
可恶！

周一前把样品交给杂志社 应该就没问题了

Let me tell you something, I ate 40 Mallomars today.
跟你说 我今天吃了40个棉花糖

我连续两天都失眠 我们昨天才戒烟的

That's counting today.

352
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,500
But anyway, so these samples,I think
言归正传，我想这些样品…

353
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,100
Oh,my God!
天啊

354
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:41,730
I'm so sorry, I forgot. I have to go to the mailroom and mail some proofs.
我忘记了，真的很抱歉 我得去收发室寄送样张

00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:45,210
Go ahead. Rachel and I will just sit here and keep brainstorming.
尽管去 我和瑞秋继续来脑力激荡

356
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,970
Also,Vogue called. And they were wondering
时尚杂志也想知道… 你知道吗？…

357
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:52,980
You know what? I'm a little hungry. I'm just gonna run down to the vending machines.
我有点饿了 我要去贩卖机买东西

358
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,580
All right.
好吧

359
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,920
Busted!
被逮到了

360
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,230
Come on! What are you doing? I thought we were the Patch Sisters.
你们这是在干嘛？ 我们不是戒烟姐妹花吗？

361
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,060
That didn't work out.
对，那样行不通

362
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,570
Wait a minute. What about all we've talked about?
那我们说过的那些事呢？

363
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,110
You know,the disgusting place, the ugly people.

Hey,how you doing?

We tried to quit. But it was too hard.
瑞秋，我们有试着戒烟 但那实在是太难了

366
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:33,290
If you started smoking again, you could have at least told me.
你们开始抽烟 起码也该告诉我嘛

367
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,050
Give me one of those. What are we talking about?
快点来一支，刚才说到哪里？

368
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,660
No! You're doing great! Don't you give up.
不行，你戒烟很成功 不许放弃

369
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,830
That's why we didn't tell you, and we won't drag you down.
所以我们才没跟你说 我们不想拖你下水

370
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,090
Wait. No,no. Drag me down.
等等，别这样，拖我下水…

371
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,100
Forget it. We're so proud of how well you're doing.
瑞秋，万万不可 你戒烟成功，我们都替你骄傲

I won't let you blow it. If I catch you, you're fired.
我不能让你前功尽弃 若被我捉到 我一定炒你鱿鱼

00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,510
Go on,get out of here. I don't want you breathing this stuff.
走吧，离开这里 我不要你吸二手烟

376
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,680

Check it out. Cup hat, cup banner...

Great job with the cups.

Why don't you just go out with her?

Did you notice the ice? Look!

Everyone-no one's eating my Tuscan finger food. Because they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
没人想吃我的小点心 他们全跑去吃菲比的雪花冰

There are snow cones?
有雪花冰？

390
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,624
Snow cones! Yuck!
雪花冰最恶心了！

391
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,200
-Go,go! Right there! -Thank you.
你去吃啦 谢谢…

392
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,929
菲比？

-You really did do a nice job. -Thank you...
你做的很棒 谢谢你

394
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,570

00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,540
I deserve that.

I was in charge of cups.
杯子是我负责的

413
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,560
Oh,okay. Not so weird.

414
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:57,900
-Chandler, what are you doing? -Nothing.

Let me make this clear to you,okay?
或许这能让你清醒一点

419
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,750
It's either that...
有香烟…

420
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,650
...or this.
就没有我

421
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,120
They were menthol.
刚才那是薄荷烟

426
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,010
It's not your fault I suck.
是我自己逊，怨不得你

427
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,850
What kind of an actor can't even say, "Mmm...noodle soup"?
连“面汤”都说不好 还算哪门子的演员？

428
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:01,230
You know what? Maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck.
你知道吗？或许你搞砸了试镜 不是因为你逊

429
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:06,500
Maybe you messed up because you care more about your godson.
或许你搞砸了试镜 是因为你更在意你的教子

430
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,000

什么意思？

431

I think, subconsciously
我认为，在潜意识里…

432
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,270
You lost me.
等等，我听不懂

433
