能不能停一下再丢球 先帮我找表？

152
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,580
Oh, I don't know.... Yeah,can't do it.
不知道，没办法喔

153
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,310
-What? -Do not drop that ball.
怎样啦？怎样都好 千万别把球掉地上

155
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,780
We haven't dropped it in....
我们保持球不落地已经…

156
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,990
Two hours,27 minutes.
2小时27分钟

157
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,830
Really?
真的啊？

158
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,920
I won't make it in to work today.
我今天没办法去上班 

159
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,230
I don't feel very good.
我人不太舒服

160
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,736
漂亮！

161
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:32,740
For a second, I thought I was feeling better, but I'm not.
我刚才突然觉得自己好多了 但其实没有

162
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,440
Hey, Rach.
瑞秋 嗨

163
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,410
Check it out. Almost three hours without dropping it.
快来看，球不落地接近三小时

164
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,910
Congratulations. That's quite a waste of time.
恭喜了，真是浪费时间

165
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,790
You have scratches all over you.
你身上都是抓痕，怎么了？

167
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,510
Well,it's my cat.
是我的猫 

168
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,790
-Oh,I got a cat. -I don't want a cat!
对了，我养了一只猫 我不想养猫

169
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,430
Don't worry,it's not a cat.
别担心，那不是猫 没错

171
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,200
You guys,this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat.
这只猫跟我祖母养过的猫 完全不一样

172
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,340
It's not sweet. It's not cute.
既不讨人喜欢，也不可爱

173
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,700
I dragged a string,and it flipped out and scratched the hell out of me.
我在地上拉着线逗它玩 它竟然发飙 把我抓得乱七八糟

175
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:14,380
I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me...
我知道这听来很疯狂 但我发誓 这只猫每次嘘我的时候

177
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,540
...I know it's saying,"Rachel!"
我知道它都在说“瑞秋”

178
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,660
Doesn't sound as crazy as paying $1000 for a cat.
花一千买美元买一只猫 比刚才那些话更疯狂

179
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,160
You paid $1000 for a cat when you owe me $300?
你欠我三百美元不还 还拿一千美元去买猫？

180
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,200
Well,I was gonna let you play with it.
我本来打算让你跟它玩的

181
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,968
“中央咖啡馆”

182
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,970
Did you talk to Gary about moving in?
你跟盖瑞聊过同居的事没？

184
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,870
I think you should do it.
聊过了，我觉得你应该答应

185
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:51,220
He's a great guy and he loves you a lot. You are a very lucky lady.
他很棒，他也很爱你 你非常幸运

187
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,240
You are useless!
你真没用

188
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,890
Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do...
害怕承诺是你唯一会做的事

189
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,090
...and you can't even do that right!
你竟然连那件事都做不好！ 天啊

190
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,020
Sorry. If he asked me, I'd move in with him.
抱歉 换做我都愿意和他同居

192
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,570
Get out of here,good-for-nothing.
窝囊废，你滚吧

194
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,800
Hey,Chandler.
钱德 

195
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,270
Hey,Gar.
盖瑞

196
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,340
Hey,sweetie.
亲爱的

197
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,670
Can I talk to you for a second?
能不能先聊一下？ 好啊

198
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,880
You look pretty today.
你今天很美

199
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,710
Thanks. Okay.
谢谢，好吧

200
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,280
Here's the thing.
是这样的

201
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,620
I really want this relationship to move forward.
我很想让这段关系更进一步

202
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:35,060
If you're not moving forward, you're moving backwards.
因为不进则退

203
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,270
No, if you're not moving forward, you're staying still.
不对，那不是真的 如果不进，就是静止不动

204
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,370
And staying still is good. Watch this.
静止不动是很好的，你看

205
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,301
菲比 是

206
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,870
I want you to move in with me.
我要你搬来一起住

207
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,110
That is so sweet.
那真是太甜蜜了

208
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,640
But don't you think it's too soon?
但你不觉得太快了些吗？

209
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,140
There's so much we don't know about each other.
我们彼此还有太多地方不了解

210
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,820
Okay. I get it.
好吧，我懂了

211
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:05,990
I don't want us to jump into something that we're not ready for.
我只是不希望我们操之过急 你懂吧？

212
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,490
I don't want to mess up what we have.
我不想搞砸我们现在的一切

213
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:16,100
I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.
我担心同居会铸成大错

214
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:17,533
是啊

215
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,500
Which is why my answer is yes!
所以我的答案是我答应

216
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,410
Really?
真的吗？

217
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,610
You're so happy.
我好快乐

218
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,780
Monica, stop throwing it so hard!
摩妮卡，别丢那么大力！

219
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,420
We're on the same team!
我们是同一队

220
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:46,160
You guys have been doing this for four hours?
四个小时？ 你们就这样丢了四小时？

221
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,800
That's right,baby.
宝贝，没错

222
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,660
-All right. Let me in. -No,no! Don't do it!
好，让我加入 不行！…

224
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,870
What?
什么？

225
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,640
He's a dropper.
他是掉球大王

226
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,510
Oh,yeah. That's right!
对，没错！

227
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,340
I'm not a dropper!
我才不是掉球大王

228
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:05,010
It's really a three-person game, you know?
这其实是三个人的游戏

229
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,120
It's throwing and catching.
还不就是你丢我接

230
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,420
All right.
好吧

231
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,420
Oh,it's so hard.
好大力喔

232
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,540
Don't worry,guys. It's not a cat.
别紧张，那不是猫喔

233
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,070
Oh,good God!
我的…天啊

234
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,540
I give up. I don't know what I'm gonna do with this thing.
我放弃了 我不知道要怎么处理

235
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,140
Baking it didn't help?
送它进烤箱也没用？

236
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,120
Take it back to where you got it.
把它送回你买的地方呢？

237
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,220
I tried. They won't take her back.
我试过了，他们不收

238
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,890
Maybe that's because she's a minion of the Antichrist.
或许是因为它是反基督的爪牙

239
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,900
Why won't they take it?
瑞秋，店家为什么不收？

240
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,620
They said they would only give me store credit.
他们说要收回可以 但只退我店里的购物券

241
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,200
What am I gonna do? Get 1000 regular cats?
我要拿来买什么？ 一千只普通的猫不成？

242
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,340
You said it was a show cat. Why don't you show it,win some prize money.
你不是说这是展示猫吗？ 那就带去比赛拿奖品啊

243
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,240
Those shows cost a hundred bucks to enter, and all you win are these ribbons...
参加猫展要先缴一百美元 赢来的东西

245
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,370
...which technically belong to the damn cat.
还不是都归这死猫所有

246
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,950
You can keep it until you find out what to do with it.
不然你先留着罗 等到你找到处理的方法

247
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,550
That's not the point. I'm out $1000...
不行，那不是重点 我破费一千美元

249
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,250
...I'm all scratched up...
搞得全身都是抓痕

250
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,820
...and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!
还跟长得像手的蠢猫困在一起

251
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,450
Oh,my God!
天啊

252
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,330
The cat's made my eyes water. Don't throw it to me!
那只猫害我流眼泪了 别丢球给我！

253
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,230
My vision's been compromised!
我的视力被连累到了

254
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,410
Oh,God! Okay.
天啊，好了…

255
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,670
It's okay. Man,that was close.
现在好了，真是惊险

256
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,640
Yeah,you almost overreacted to something.
是啊，你的反应也太大了点

257
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:46,650
-We have great news. -We're moving in together. Yay!
我们有个好消息 我们要同居了，是不是很棒？

259
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,590
Congratulations.
恭喜… 

260
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,280
-I'm so excited! -So am l.
是啊 我好兴奋 我也是

261
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:55,220
You're not more excited than I am. No way. I'm the most excited.
你才没有我兴奋，不可能 我是最兴奋的

262
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,330
See you at the station later.
好，晚点在局里见

263
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,500
I'll see you later. Don't forget about the moving-in!
好，晚点见 别忘了同居的事喔

264
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,730
So you're moving in with him?
你要搬去跟他住，怎么了？

265
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:07,900
I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right.
我不忍心拒绝他 看他伤心成那样 或许不会有事的

267
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,640
I do like him a lot...
我真的很喜欢他 

268
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,570
...and probably do it eventually,anyway.
同居八成也是迟早的事

269
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,820
Plus,think of all the money I'll save on stamps.
想想也可以省下不少邮票钱

270
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,280
Do you write him a lot?
怎么着？你常写信给他？

271
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,520
I heard when people live together...
不是，只是我听说同居的人 

272
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,190
...they split the cost of stamps,don't they?
会分担邮票的费用，不是吗？

273
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,920
-Yeah,yeah. -That's right.
是啊，没错…

274
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,330
Sorry,the oven mitts really freaked me out.
抱歉，耐热手套吓了我一跳

275
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,430
Hey,honey.
亲爱的

276
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,670
Did you find any apartments in Brooklyn Heights?
你找到公寓没？ 布鲁克林高地有吗？

277
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,040
No, nothing.
不，没找到

278
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,540
-Oh, really? -Yeah.
真的？ 是啊

279
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,050
-Nothing at all? -No.
一间都没有？ 没有

280
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:55,350
If something opens up,we'll move in. If it has a pool. I need a pool.
只要有公寓招租 我们马上搬进去 不过要有附泳池的 我需要泳池

282
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,280
Can I talk to you?

You feel all right?

I feel great, because we're moving in together.

So you....

288
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:18,910
You checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights,right?
报上布鲁克林高地的租屋广告 你都看过了？

289
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,640
You checked the Post?
邮报你有查过吗？

290
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,380
Yeah,there was nothing.

291
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,690
-Can I get some water? -ln a minute.

Because this is today's Post.

00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,170
