1
00:00:07,04 --> 00:00:09,97
None of that. Not while you're under my roof!
不准这样，还住在我屋里 就得守规矩

2
00:00:10,67 --> 00:00:11,80
什么？

3
00:00:12,21 --> 00:00:16,20
Just because I know about you doesn't mean I like looking at it.
就算我知道内幕 也不代表我喜欢看你们亲热

4
00:00:16,88 --> 00:00:19,18
Aren't you supposed to be at an audition?

I'm sorry I'm not a middle-aged black woman.

I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition.

7
00:00:30,89 --> 00:00:33,22
If I pretend to not know about you...
你们要我假装不知道 

8
00:00:33,50 --> 00:00:36,02
...then you pretend there's nothing to know.
就得假装你们没怎样

9
00:00:37,67 --> 00:00:38,65
Sorry.
抱歉 对不起

11
00:00:44,54 --> 00:00:46,47

My mom sent me an heirloom that belonged to my grandmother.

The only heirloom I ever got was a feather boa.
我小时只有一条羽毛围巾

21
00:02:02,88 --> 00:02:06,08
Got if from my dad. He got it from his dad.
我爷爷传给我老爸再传给我

22
00:02:07,06 --> 00:02:09,65
How did I ever get born?

23
00:02:19,33 --> 00:02:20,32
Oh,God!
天啊

24
00:02:23,44 --> 00:02:24,84
Soft.
好软

25
00:02:26,07 --> 00:02:27,41
Is this mink?
这是貂皮吗？

26
00:02:27,88 --> 00:02:32,75
Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all?
对，我妈为何寄皮草给我？她完全不了解我吗？

I have a fine coat that no innocent animals suffered to make.
我已经有外套了 而且还没牺牲任何可怜动物

29
00:02:38,02 --> 00:02:41,11
Just Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody...
只不过是时薪12分钱的 

30
00:02:41,36 --> 00:02:42,72
...for 12 cents an hour.
九岁菲律宾童工卖命做的

31
00:02:45,73 --> 00:02:47,22
I made that up.
别听我的，我胡说的

32
00:02:52,27 --> 00:02:54,86
You can't put up flyers in here.
罗斯，你不能在这里贴广告

34
00:02:55,27 --> 00:02:57,07
How come? Everybody else does.
为什么？别人都可以

35
00:02:58,04 --> 00:02:59,47
You can't.
就是你不行

36
00:03:02,31 --> 00:03:03,61

Yes,it is.

40
00:03:13,56 --> 00:03:17,05
It's good. Emily thinks we should get all new stuff.
没关系，艾蜜莉说 我们应该买新家具

41
00:03:17,29 --> 00:03:20,26
Stuff that's just ours. Together. Brand new.
光属于我们俩的家具 也就是全新的东西

42
00:03:20,50 --> 00:03:23,43
So it's a get-rid-of-anything- Rachel-ever-touched sale.
基本上这是 “瑞秋碰过家具”大拍卖

43
00:03:23,83 --> 00:03:26,43
Touched,used,sat on,slept on....

00:03:31,91 --> 00:03:33,74
If I can just do what Emily wants...
只要顺着艾蜜莉 

47
00:03:33,98 --> 00:03:36,74
...and get her to New York, it will be fine.
她来纽约后就没事了

48
00:03:36,98 --> 00:03:38,97
Isn't that a little extreme?
但是这种做法也太极端了吧

49
00:03:39,25 --> 00:03:42,18
After what I did,can you blame her?
毕竟我说错名字 你能怪她吗？

50
00:03:42,45 --> 00:03:43,44
You got off easy.
你已经算轻松了

Emily thinks Ross' furniture has got Rachel cooties?
艾蜜莉觉得罗斯的家具 会沾上瑞秋的虱子吗？

Everything's getting all messed up!

Emily won't let Ross see Rachel.

Hence,Ross stops seeing us.

I hate this. Everything's changing.

We're losing Ross. Joey said "hence."
我知道，我们不能再见罗斯 乔伊还会用“因此”

65
00:04:33,77 --> 00:04:38,23

我也不高兴 但是如果罗斯能开心

67
00:04:38,47 --> 00:04:41,44
...then we have to keep our feelings to ourselves.

Are you cool with that?

I'll act cool.

Probably be some of the hardest acting I've ever done.

Maybe I'll play it with a mustache.

74
00:05:05,83 --> 00:05:08,83
Storage rooms give me the creeps.
天啊，我怕死储藏室了

75
00:05:09,04 --> 00:05:11,34

If you want little round waffles, wait till I find the iron.

Right underneath the can of bug bomb.

You know what? I'll have toast.

Fog him! Fog him!

嗨，抱歉打扰你

别太喜欢，她要烧掉了

157
00:09:57,56 --> 00:09:59,74

But if you destroy a coat like this...
但是你毁掉这么棒的皮草 

160
00:10:06,33 --> 00:10:09,50
...that is like a crime against nature.
实在是不合天理

161
00:10:09,97 --> 00:10:12,17
Not nature. Fashion!
说错了，是有违时尚流行

162
00:10:12,64 --> 00:10:14,04
This is fashion?
这叫做流行？

163

So to you,death is fashion?
尸体叫做流行？

164

Because I do!

What is in here,rocks?

I'll miss this apartment.

You know,Ben took his first steps right over there.

178
00:11:09,70 --> 00:11:13,33
Remember when I ran into this and it knocked me out?

I love this place.

To tell the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
老实说，我真希望别搬家

181
00:11:20,78 --> 00:11:25,27
Are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
你的意思是你也不想走？

182
00:11:25,48 --> 00:11:27,97
If Emily gave me a choice

Why are you listening to her? Are you crazy?
罗斯，你为什么要听她的？ 你疯了吗？

Stop pinching me!

He just told me that he's not entirely happy.
可是他刚说他也不开心

191

We just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.

How about we have this conversation when one of you marries?
要是以后你们谁结婚 大伙也有这种反应呢？

202

You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work.
你们根本不知道如何维持婚姻

203
00:12:26,01 --> 00:12:28,60
It's compromise. Do you always like it? No.

Do you do it? Yes.

It's real life,okay?

I think he's right.

-I feel so guilty about Ross. -I know.

Kind of?
似乎？

215
00:13:08,05 --> 00:13:10,61
You should have kept this to yourself.
要不是你大嘴巴 也不会有这种下场

216
00:13:10,99 --> 00:13:15,92
I'm keeping so many things to myself, something was bound to slip out!
我最近知道的秘密太多 总有说溜嘴的时候

I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
我坐不住了，我得去走走

219
00:13:26,10 --> 00:13:29,23
What's with the coat? How about the animal rights thing?
菲比，你怎么还穿那件外套？ 你不是关心动物吗？

220

Okay,I admit it. I love this coat,okay?
好，我承认，我喜欢这件外套

这是裹在我身上最棒的东西 菲尔杭利都不够好

你还记得菲尔吗？ 他帅呆了

227
00:14:06,67 --> 00:14:07,77

237
00:14:37,17 --> 00:14:38,16
What?
什么？

238
00:14:38,47 --> 00:14:39,46
It's cool.
没关系，无所谓

239
00:14:40,51 --> 00:14:42,30
No,that is not cool.

You don't even know me.

You got the shopping bags and the Saks catalog.
你提着一堆购物袋 还拿着百货公司目录

242

From that,you've got me all figured out?
你以为这样就能看透我？

243
00:14:51,79 --> 00:14:53,01
Well,you don't.

You know,I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here.

I judged you. I made a snap judgment.
好，我不该光看你外表

251
00:15:24,75 --> 00:15:29,02
But you did it too,and you're worse. You're sticking to your judgment.
当时我只靠第一印象 可是你也一样
而且更糟糕 因为你只相信第一印象

You can't even open your mind to see you might be wrong.
甚至不肯反省自己对不对 

255
00:15:32,86 --> 00:15:34,35
What does that say about you?

That pizza place across the street any good?

Are you still mad?

Whatever you decide, whatever you do.

Now you're just taking lines out of the song.

Let's get some perspective,people.

283
00:16:51,01 --> 00:16:54,30
It's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!
这又不是 用导盲犬的皮做的

不过瑞秋肯定不在

335
00:19:41,18 --> 00:19:45,24
I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now.

You know what? Rachel is here.

How could you do this to me?

You can't know where I am all the time.
你不可能永远掌握我的行踪

Honey,is there anything we can do?

Stop tormenting me!

Most of these probably wanted to be coats.
