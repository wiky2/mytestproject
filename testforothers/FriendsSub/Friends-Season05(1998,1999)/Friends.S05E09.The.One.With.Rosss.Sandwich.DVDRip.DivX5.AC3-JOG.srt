I take my underwear off in other people's homes.

我只好说是我的 还说我要在话剧里演女人

Then one thing led to another,and....

35
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,870
And around the ankles, that is a tough spot.

It was. All right,listen

All this lying has been hard on us too.

We'll be more careful.

We don't want them to know because it's going really well.
因为我们实在太甜蜜了 所以不想告诉别人

44
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,700
And maybe it's going well because it's a secret.
搞不好就是保密才能这么顺利

45
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,460
It sounds weird, but we're so bad at relationships.
我知道你觉得很怪 但我们都不太会处理感情问题

46
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,740
-We are. Help us! -Help!

All right. But you do it with me once.

罗斯，你以为菲比 当年是在演温苦女流浪记吗？

So,what is the book about?

112
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,360
Didn't you read it in high school?
你说你高中念过

113
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,660
I started it,but then there was this pep rally.
对，后来我想起我开始看时 正好碰上要为球队打气

...what's the book about?
到底在说什么？

117
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,840
It's a tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff.
这是凯西跟希克里夫的 悲惨爱情故事

118
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,980
It takes place on these creepy moors in England.
故事发生在英国可怕的山庄

119
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:02,310
Which I think represent the wildness of Heathcliff's character.
场景就代表 男主角性格中狂野的一面

120
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,210
I totally get symbolism.
我对象徵主义很有一套

121
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,880
How would you characterize the theme of this book?
这本书的主题是什么？

122
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,020
Let's see.... Rachel Greene?
看看找谁…瑞秋葛林

123
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:20,400
I would have to say that it's a tragic love story.
这是个…爱情悲剧

124
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,370
That's sort of a given...
非常明显

125
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,540
...but,yes. Anyone else?
不过你说得也没错 还有谁有意见？

126
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,830
Symbolism!
还有象徵性的意义

127
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,240
And the wildness of the moors...
狂野的场景…

128
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,980
...which I think,is mirrored...
反映出 

129
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,650
...in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.
男主角性格中桀傲的一面

130
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,720
Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here....

You completely stole my answer!

Honey,that was pretty obvious.

134
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,560
How would you know? You didn't read it!
你哪晓得？你根本没念过

135
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,940
What do you think? You in the blue shirt?
你有何意见呢？ 穿蓝衬衫这位同学？

137
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:05,240
I think that yours is a question with many possible answers.
我认为这个问题 有很多可能的答案

138
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,410
Would you care to venture one?
那就麻烦你举出一个

139
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,520
Would you care to venture one?

140
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,850
Are you just repeating me?

Are you just repeating me?

142
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,420
All right. Let's move on.

143
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,390
Okay,then.
好

144
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,930
Why didn't you say you hadn't read the book?
你为什么不直接说你没看过？

145
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,640
I didn't want him to think I was stupid.
我不希望他认为我很蠢

146
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,970
That was really embarrassing, what happened to you.

Not only did no one touch my sandwich...
不但没人敢碰我的三明治 

151
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,290
...but people at work are actually afraid of me.
而且还开始对我敬畏三分

152
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,550
A guy called me "Mental."
还有人叫我疯子

153
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,260
"Mental Geller."
疯子盖勒

154
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,560
I've always wanted a cool nickname like that.
我一直梦想有这种超酷外号

155
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,490
The best you got in high school was "Wet Pants Geller."
以前你最酷的外号 就是“尿裤子盖勒”

156
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,500
It was the water fountain,okay?!
那是饮水机喷到的

157
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,660
Anyway...
现在...

158
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,400
...people are writing reports for me...
有人愿意帮我写报告

159
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:13,140
...pushing back deadlines to fit my schedule.
我爱什么时候交就什么时候交

160
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,610
I tell you, you get tough with people...
原来对人耍狠...

161
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,610
...and you can get anything you want.
...就可以呼风唤雨

162
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,820
Hey,Tribbiani! Give me that coffee! Now!
崔比亚尼，咖啡拿来

163
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,260
This was really fun.
今天真有意思

164
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,670
I've been wondering if you'd ask me out.
我本来还怀疑你会不会约我

165
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,270
So you still wondering?
你还在怀疑吗？

166
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,340
No. We just went out.
我们已经去约会啦

167
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,500
You're smart.
你真聪明

168
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,610
I like that.
我喜欢

169
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,350
Oh,candles!
还有蜡烛啊

170
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,020
What is that,a blanket?
这是什么？毯子？

171
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,820
A video camera? Oh,my God!
摄影机？ 我的天啊

172
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:10,400
I can't believe you thought you'd tape us having sex on the first date!
你竟然第一次约会 就想拍下我们上床过程

174
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:16,673
你好

175
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,540
Joey,is what she just said....
乔伊，她刚说的…

176
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,040
Oh,my God!
天啊

177
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,750
You're actually going
你还真打算…

178
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,220
What is going on here?
这是怎么回事？

179
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,090
And with Chandler in the next room. What are you,sick?
而且钱德还在家 你是…你是变态吗？

180
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,870
I'm Joey.
我是乔伊啊

181
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,740
I mean, I'm disgusting.
我本来就恶心

182
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,610
I make low-budget adult films.
还拍低成本的A片

183
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,180
You promised to be more careful!
你们答应我要更小心的

184
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,520
The good Joey name's been dragged through the mud!
乔伊的好名声都给你们毁了

185
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:13,760
We're so sorry.
对不起 抱歉

186
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,470
I'm telling everyone.
我要把你们的事情说出去

187
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:20,470
It's the only explanation that doesn't make me look like a pig!
否则内裤跟摄影机的事情 只会让人觉得我是变态猪猡

188
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,500
No,there's a better explanation.
等一下，一定有其他方法

189
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,240
Tell them you had to make an adult film for your...
你可以说你在拍A片 因为你在…

190
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,710
...adult film class.
...上A片课

191
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,640
I like that. But no!
这理由还不错 不过不行

192
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:35,190
How does that explain my underwear at your place?
瑞秋在你家发现我内裤的事又怎么说？

193
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:37,850
I don't know.
不知道

194
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,660
Get ready to come out of the non-gay closet.
看来你们得出柜承认了

195
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,990
I promise to come up with something. Just give us time.
拜托你等等 我保证一定会想出理由 再多给我们缓几天

197
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,360
All right.
好吧

198
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,700
But it better make me look really good.
最好让我保住面子

199
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,410
And another thing:
还有…

200
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,240
The video camera?
摄影机？

201
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,740
Nice!
神来之笔！

202
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,615
“史前历史博物馆”

204
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,650
May I have a word?
罗斯，可以跟你谈谈吗？

205
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,190
Of course,Donald.
当然，唐诺

206
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,360
We've been getting reports of very angry behavior on your part.
有同事抱怨你最近脾气火爆

207
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,030
-What? -Threatening letters...
什么？ 写信威胁大家...

208
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,160
...refusal to meet deadlines.
拒绝按时交报告

209
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,000
Apparently people now call you Mental.
还有人说你是疯子

210
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:25,671
是啊

211
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,930
We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.
我们希望你找精神科医生谈谈

213
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,110
You don't understand. This is so silly.
不，你不懂，其实是误会


214
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,540
This is all just because of a sandwich.
一切要从我的三明治说起

215
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,050
A sandwich?
三明治？

216
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,860
You see,my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches.
我妹妹非常会做火鸡三明治

217
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:51,130
Her secret is,she puts an extra slice of gravy-soaked bread in the middle.
她的秘诀就是 多夹一片浸过肉汁的面包

218
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,230
I call it "The Moistmaker."
我称那片为“多汁秘方”

219
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,230
Anyway,I put my sandwich in the fridge....
有一次我把三明治放在冰箱

220
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,470
Oh,you know what?
你知道吗？ 什么？

221
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,930
I'm sorry.
对不起

222
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,100
I believe I ate that.
应该是我吃掉了

223
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,080
You ate my sandwich?
你吃了我的三明治？

224
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,810
A simple mistake. It can happen to anyone.
我一时看错，谁都可能拿错

225
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,110
Oh,really?
是吗？

226
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:20,750
Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moistmaker?
难道你的三明治 也有“多汁秘方”？

227
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,560
Do you,perhaps,remember...
难道...

228
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,330
...seeing a note on top of it?
...你没看到上面的纸条？ 

229
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:32,630
There may have been a joke or limerick of some kind.
我以为那是有人开玩笑 或是随手写的打油诗

230
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,740
That said it was...
上面清楚地写着...

231
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,770
...my sandwich!
...那是我的三明治

232
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,110
Now,calm down.
你别激动

233
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:42,450
Look in my office. Some may be in the trash.
可以到我办公室找找 可能垃圾筒里还有剩

234
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,120
What？
什么？

235
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,290
It was quite large. I had to throw most of it away.
那个三明治很大 我哪里吃得了那么多

238
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:55,020
You threw my sandwich away?
你…丢掉我的三明治

239
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,030
My sandwich?!
我的三明治

240
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:01,305
My sandwich?!
我的三明治

241
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,460
What's this book about?
这本书在讲什么？

243
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,040
You didn't read it,either?
你这本也没看？

244
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:10,770
I was going to,but I accidentally read something else.
我本来要看，结果看了别本书

245
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,840
Vogue.
“时尚杂志”

247
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,650
So tell me about Jane Eyre.
这个简爱是干嘛的？

248
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,440
No,read it yourself.
不行，你应该自己看

249
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,520
Come on, don't be such a goody-goody.
菲比，别这么假正经嘛

250
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,680
Fine.
好吧

251
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,020
All right. So,Jane Eyre?
简爱呢…

252
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:29,890
First,you'd think she's a woman, but she's not.
你会以为她是女人 其实不然

253
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,530
She's a cyborg.
她是生化人

254
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,500
A cyborg? Isn't that like a robot?
生化人？就是机器人？

255
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,510
This book was light years ahead of its time.
这本书在当时超级先进

256
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,510
Sorry I'm late. Let's get started.
抱歉迟到，开始上课吧

257
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,140
What did you think of Jane Eyre?
大家对简爱有何感想？

258
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:53,650
Rachel and I were discussing it, and she had very interesting insights.
瑞秋刚跟我讨论过 她有些看法非常有趣

259
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,320
Go ahead,Rachel.
请说，瑞秋

260
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,990
Thank you,Phoebe.
谢谢你，菲比

261
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,160
What struck me most when reading Jane Eyre...
简爱最让我震惊的就是 

262
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,530
...was how the book was so ahead of its time.
这本书非常惊世骇俗

263
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:11,570
If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
如果你指的是女性主义 这么说也成

264
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,070
Well,feminism,yes. But also the robots.
当然有写到女性主义 不过还有机器人

265
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,719
嘿 嘿

266
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,920
Since that video camera thing didn't work out...
既然上次要拍摄不成功

267
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,230
...I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
我先给你一点预告片段

268
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,960
You're naked!
你没穿衣服

269
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,250
I know!
我知道

270
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,176
罗斯

271
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,409
钱德

272
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,044
摩妮卡

273
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,280
Are you okay?
罗斯，你没事吧？

274
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,920
I'm fine.
我很好

275
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,820
I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
我今天上班去看过精神医生

276
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,250
Why?
为什么？

277
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,490
On account of my rage.
因为我脾气太暴躁

278
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:10,260
Which,if I may say, right now is out of control.
而且最近越来越严重

279
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,830
He gave me a pill for it.
所以他开药丸给我

280
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,330
A pill?
药丸？

281
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:20,070
When the psychiatrist told me to take a leave of absence...
医生说我应该请假

282
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:24,610
...because I yelled at my boss, I started to get worked up again.
因为我对上司大吼大叫 我又开始暴跳如雷

284
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,510
So he offered me a tranquilizer.
所以他要我吃颗镇定剂

285
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,010
And I thought it was a good idea.
我觉得这主意不错

286
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,810
So I took it.
所以就吃了

287
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,590
They're making you take time off work?
等等，他们逼你请假？

288
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,160
And you're okay with that?
而且你也同意？

289
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,930
I don't know.
我不晓得

290
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:43,990
It's going to be weird not having a job for a while.
刚开始不工作可能不习惯

291
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,430
But I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
不过我已经不在乎三明治了

292
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,030
I hate it when they make me see the shrink at my office.
公司逼我看心理医生时 我也很火大

293
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:57,080
He's always like, "Your colleagues will like you better if you like yourself better."
他老说“如果你多爱自己 同事就会更喜欢你”

294
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,800
Who needs that?
谁需要这套垃圾？

295
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,380
-You do. -I know.
你啊 我知道

296
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:07,710
It's so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on like that!
我丢脸丢大了 你竟然还让我说下去

297
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,320
I'm sorry.
对不起

298
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:15,460
It was so funny when you compared Jane Eyre to Robocop.
你把简爱比做机器战警 实在太爆笑了

299
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,720
That was not funny!
一点也不好笑

But I also wanted to learn.

大家老说在高中学东学西 我却没上过高中

So you really wanted to learn.

You know,Phoebe, I just wanted to have fun.

You know who should go?

00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,190
Wait! Everybody calm down,okay?
等一下，大家先别激动

要给我们的老友乔伊 有机会解释他为何如此病态

It's okay! It's good!

I slept with Monica.

We just did it once,in London.

Of course,it's true.

Yes,it's true.

My God,Monica!

Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
你确定，乔伊？ 你确定你不是性爱狂？

要是有人是性爱狂 那也是摩妮卡

363
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:06,020
She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
没错，打从我们自伦敦回来 她就想再勾引我上床

364
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,930
That's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.

And the video camera?
录影机呢？

我架好录影机是为了 引诱乔伊上钩

370
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,980
Monica,this has to stop now.
摩妮卡，你不能再这样下去

371
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,150
I know,I know.

...drop it immediately,and forever.

You really kept Joey's underwear?

Why? Why would you do that?

381
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,750
I'm Monica.
因为我是摩妮卡

382
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,350
I'm disgusting.
生性下流

383
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,990
I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
我会跟踪男人 留下他们的内裤

I think we've all learned who's disgusting and who's not.
现在终于知道谁是恶心鬼了

385
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:29,080
Now,I'm going to get back to my bucket.
好了，我要开始吃炸鸡了

386
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:33,740
I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
我只吃鸡皮，你们可以吃鸡肉

387
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,680
You were making a good point.
你说得很有道理

388
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,860
I mean,till you got cut off.
可惜后来被打断

389
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,560
What's up with that girl Monica?
那个摩妮卡哪里有病啊？

390
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,660
I don't know. I didn't come with her.
谁晓得？她不是我朋友

391
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:53,200
Hey,everybody! Everybody,guess what!
好消息，各位 你们猜怎么了？

392
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,730
I just convinced Carl to give us a test.
