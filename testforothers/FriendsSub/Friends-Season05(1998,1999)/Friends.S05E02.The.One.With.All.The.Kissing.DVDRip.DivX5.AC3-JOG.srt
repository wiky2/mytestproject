Sorry,it's just because I couldn't be there.
是我不好，因为我去不了

你知道我伤心时都怎么做吗？

155

What the hell was that?

Probably some European goodbye thing he picked up in London.

174
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,160
It felt French.
比较像法式热吻

00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:53,550
You're not going anywhere. Sit right here.
罗斯，你哪也别去 就坐这里

Rachel locked the door.

I'm going to do it.

271
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,690
-Did you find anyone who agrees with you? -No.
瑞秋，你找到谁支持你了吗？ 还没

That sucks!

That's not a trip! I just came from there.
那根本不算旅行 我才刚从公园过来

Just bringing some culture to the group.

不行，瑞秋，没有人支持你 所以你不能说

You know what? That doesn't matter.

325
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,310
...and not have them say it back?

Because I just heard it!

I heard it. And it's ridiculous!
