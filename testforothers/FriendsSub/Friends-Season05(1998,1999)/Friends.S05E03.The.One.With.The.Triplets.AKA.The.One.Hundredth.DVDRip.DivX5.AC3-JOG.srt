我不是方奇

150
00:09:33,80 --> 00:09:38,14
It's a terrific thing that you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.
说真的 你能替你弟生孩子真的很棒

151
00:09:38,34 --> 00:09:40,00
No,it is.
的确

152
00:09:40,88 --> 00:09:42,71
Can I tell you a secret?
我可以告诉你一个秘密吗？ 你说

153
00:09:43,74 --> 00:09:45,64
I want to keep one.
我要自己留一个

154
00:09:50,55 --> 00:09:52,52
Oh,I'm gonna be on the news.
天哪，我会上新闻

155
00:09:54,76 --> 00:09:56,02
You must be kidding.
菲比，别开玩笑了 

156
00:09:56,26 --> 00:09:58,89
You know you can't keep one of these babies.
你明知你不能这么做

157
00:09:59,09 --> 00:10:01,08
Maybe I can. You don't know.
为什么？搞不好可以 你怎么知道

158
00:10:01,30 --> 00:10:05,32
I do. Frank and Alice will want to keep all their children.
我当然知道 法兰克他们一定三个都要

159
00:10:05,53 --> 00:10:07,97
Maybe not. You know?
不一定

160
00:10:08,47 --> 00:10:10,49
Three babies are a handful.
三个宝宝很多 

161
00:10:10,71 --> 00:10:12,97
Maybe they'll want to unload one.
也许他们正在找机会送走一个

162
00:10:14,68 --> 00:10:18,70
I hate to miss an opportunity because I didn't ask.
我不想因为没开口而失去机会

163
00:10:20,98 --> 00:10:23,11
Phoebe,no. This is insane.
菲比，这件事太扯了

164
00:10:23,32 --> 00:10:24,44
Just ask him.
你就问问看嘛 

165
00:10:24,65 --> 00:10:26,35
What? Me?
我？

166
00:10:26,82 --> 00:10:27,81
I can't ask him!
我不能自己问 

167
00:10:28,06 --> 00:10:31,39
Do you know how inappropriate that would be?
你知道那样多不成体统吗？

168
00:10:32,73 --> 00:10:35,22
All I'm saying is, just talk to Frank.
总之你去找法兰克谈 

169
00:10:35,43 --> 00:10:36,76
Just feel him out.
探探他的口风

170
00:10:36,96 --> 00:10:40,56
No. I will not ask Frank to give you one of his kids.
不行，我怎么能叫法兰克 送你一个孩子

171
00:10:42,47 --> 00:10:43,49
You're right.
你说得对

172
00:10:49,08 --> 00:10:50,98
Tell him it's for you.
就说是你要的

173
00:10:53,35 --> 00:10:54,94
Feeling better,sweetie?
好一点了吗？ 

174
00:10:55,18 --> 00:10:56,91
Maybe a little.
一点点吧

175
00:10:57,12 --> 00:10:58,92
Wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
真希望你没看到我吐

176
00:11:00,45 --> 00:11:01,68
Me too.
我也希望

177
00:11:04,83 --> 00:11:06,29
I just heard. What's up?
我刚刚听说，怎么回事？ 

178
00:11:06,49 --> 00:11:08,36
Kidney stones!
肾结石

179
00:11:11,63 --> 00:11:15,63
Ordinarily,we try to break the stones up with shock waves.
通常我们会用冲击波震碎结石 

180
00:11:15,84 --> 00:11:18,24
But they're too close to the bladder.
但你的结石已经太靠近膀胱

181
00:11:18,44 --> 00:11:22,47
Either we wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra
不是等你排尿排出来 就是从尿道往上…

182
00:11:25,68 --> 00:11:28,84
No,no,no,no. Nothing is going up,okay?
不行，不能往上 绝对不考虑往上

183
00:11:30,32 --> 00:11:33,65
Up is not an option. What's a urethra?
尿道是什么？

185
00:11:36,86 --> 00:11:37,98
Are you crazy?
你疯了吗？

186
00:11:41,53 --> 00:11:43,16
Did you ask him?
你问他了吗？

187
00:11:43,36 --> 00:11:45,26
No,I haven't had a chance yet.
我还没有机会跟他独处

188
00:11:45,47 --> 00:11:47,13
I'm kind of on a clock here.
我的时间有限

189
00:11:50,07 --> 00:11:51,63
Oh,Fonzie.
方奇

190
00:11:55,18 --> 00:11:57,54
You know who I always liked? Mork.
我一直都很喜欢魔克

191
00:12:01,15 --> 00:12:02,67
Undo it. Undo it.

00:12:05,19 --> 00:12:06,68
Fonzie met Mork.
方奇遇见魔克

00:12:06,99 --> 00:12:08,89
Mork froze Fonzie.
魔克把方奇结冻

194
00:12:10,06 --> 00:12:10,89
对

196
00:12:12,99 --> 00:12:17,22
But Fonzie was already cool.
但是方奇本来就很酷“冷”

197
00:12:18,93 --> 00:12:21,33
So he wasn't hurt. Right?
所以他不会有事，对吧？

198
00:12:22,40 --> 00:12:23,84
Yeah,that's right.
也对

199
00:12:26,91 --> 00:12:28,27
How you doing?

Okay. Doctor says any minute now.

You know,Alice is going to be here so soon.

202
00:12:35,02 --> 00:12:40,45
You couldn't just do me a favor and,like,hold them in?
你能不能帮个忙… 先憋住？

204

Sorry,I'm in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.
抱歉，我正在处理 你请我帮的最后一个忙

Kind of girlie,isn't it?

That's okay. I'm doing this to get through medical school.
没关系 这只是医学院的实习学分

216
00:13:23,40 --> 00:13:25,99
And it didn't feel "girlie" during the Gulf War.
