讽刺的是大部分的箱子 都标示着“衣服”

00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,210
-Oh,man. -No,no,it's okay.
没关系

140
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,940
Because you know what the difference between them and me is?
我跟他们的差别是…

141
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,170
Your history of bedwetting?

142
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,380
Hey,I trusted you,man!

...I've got the edge.

146
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,380
...to tip the scales in my direction.
...去贿赂他

147
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,190
You can see it from the window.
从窗户搞不好看得到

148
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,660
-Is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it? -No.

A basket of mini muffins.

The small one.

You actually thought that basket was going to get you the apartment?

155
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:04,190
Someone sent us a basket at work, and people went crazy over those muffins.

160
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:19,270
There's 12 bucks I'll never see again.
那12块算是丢到水里了

161
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,580
We'd better go if we want to catch that movie.

Bye, Chandler. I miss you already.

Are you serious?

She knows,and she's trying to freak us out!

That's the only explanation!

Not "unless"! This must end now!

They think they are so slick messing with us.

But they don't know that we know that they know.
她们不知道我们知道她们知道

191
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,360
So

You know what you should do?

你应该找出他的嗜好 拿来跟他套交情

207
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,960
Like if I wanted something from Joey...
例如我对乔伊有所求 

208
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,360
...I would strike up a conversation about sandwiches...

That is a great idea!

213
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,070
And I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for five years.
而且我了解丑裸男 因为我们偷窥了他5年

214
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,450
So that gives me back my edge!
所以我又重新占了上风

215

Let's see now. He had the trampoline.

216
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:16,880
He broke that.

So he likes to break stuff.

好，我得去接班 不过我会想出来的

Didn't he used to have a cat?

I wouldn't bring that up. It would bum him out.
别提那个，会害他心情不好

222
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,610
Poor cat never saw that big butt coming.

223
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:43,081
喂？

00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,820
Hold on a second, she's right here.

230
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,030
Joey won't be here tonight.
对，乔伊晚上不在

I cannot believe he would do that to Mon

Joey? Do they know that we know?

But that hasn't been working for me.

I cannot believe those two!
