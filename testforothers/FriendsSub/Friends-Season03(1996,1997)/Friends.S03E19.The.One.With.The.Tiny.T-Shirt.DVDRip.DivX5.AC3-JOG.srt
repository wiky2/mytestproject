Why am I only attracted to guys with no future?

Either they're too old, or they're too young.

145
00:10:48,04 --> 00:10:50,14
And there's Pete, who's crazy about me...

Why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be?

Because I sure as hell can't figure it out!

I talk to you,and nothing!

I have a question about this scene.

I don't understand why Adrianne's attracted to Victor.
爱莉安为什么会喜欢维克？

160
00:11:37,26 --> 00:11:39,02
Peel the onion.
你要抽丝剥茧

First of all,he's good-looking.

My character needs a bit more of a reason than that.

Hey,how about this one? It says so in the script!

剧本上说你是个贱人

剧本上没写 我这一本有

167
00:12:06,32 --> 00:12:09,05
I can blow-dry it,gel it. It doesn't matter.

她一直否认，结果呢 我们才刚分手，她就破功了

313
00:22:12,89 --> 00:22:16,42
So what kind of powers would "Gold Man" have?
